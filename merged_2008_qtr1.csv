PART I     
 
 
Item 1.    Business  
 
  Overview     
        Countrywide Financial Corporation (""Countrywide"") is a holding company which, through its subsidiaries (collectively, the ""Company""), is engaged in mortgage
lending and other real estate finance-related businesses, including mortgage banking, banking and mortgage warehouse lending, dealing in securities and insurance underwriting. 
        During
2007, significant disruptions occurred in the U.S. mortgage market and the global capital markets, both of which we have historically relied upon to finance our mortgage
production and operations. The combination of a weakening housing market and concern over certain industry-wide product offerings negatively impacted the expectations of future performance
and the value investors assign to mortgage loans and securities. Because of this, investor demand for non-agency mortgage-backed securities (""MBS"") abruptly declined and participants in
the debt markets substantially curtailed financing of our and others' mortgage loan inventories. 
        Mortgage
lenders, including Countrywide, responded by adjusting their loan program and underwriting standards, which had the effect of reducing the availability of mortgage credit to
borrowers. These developments further weakened the housing market and affected mortgage loan performance. 
        As
a result of all of these factors, we and other industry participants have recorded increased credit losses and inventory valuation adjustments in 2007. 
        As
more fully detailed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 17, 2008, and the Registration Statement on
Form S-4 of Bank of America Corporation (""Bank of America"") filed on February 12, 2008, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Bank of America. The
Merger Agreement provides for Countrywide to merge (the ""Merger"") with and into a wholly-owned merger subsidiary of Bank of America (""Merger Sub""), with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company. 
        The
terms of the Merger Agreement provide for the conversion of each share of Countrywide common stock into 0.1822 of a share of Bank of America common stock. Consummation of the Merger,
which is currently anticipated to occur in the third quarter of 2008, is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, Countrywide stockholder and regulatory approvals. 
        The
Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for Countrywide and Bank of America, as the case may be, applicable upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Merger
Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that, in the event of the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Countrywide may be required to pay Bank of America a termination
fee equal to $160 million. 
        The
Merger Agreement provides for both Countrywide and Bank of America to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course until the Merger is completed and not to take certain
actions during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the date of completion of the Merger. 
        We
manage our business through five business segmentsMortgage Banking, Banking, Capital Markets, Insurance and Global Operations. We primarily conduct the following
operations in these segments: 


Mortgage BankingWe originate, purchase, sell and service non-commercial mortgage loans nationwide. 

1



 




BankingWe take deposits and invest in mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, sourced primarily through
our mortgage banking operation and, to a lesser extent, through purchases from non-affiliates. We also invest in MBS, commercial real estate and construction loans and provide
short-term secured financing to mortgage lenders.
Capital MarketsWe operate an institutional broker-dealer that primarily specializes in trading and underwriting
MBS. We also trade U.S. Treasury securities, bank certificates of deposit and debt issued by government agencies. We operate other companies which broker futures contracts, provide asset management
services and originate for sale loans secured by commercial real estate. Within this segment, we also manage the acquisition and disposition of mortgage loans on behalf of the Mortgage Banking Segment
and we engage in the trading of derivative contracts.
InsuranceWe offer property, casualty, life and disability insurance as an underwriter and as an insurance
agency. We also provide reinsurance coverage to primary mortgage insurers.
Global OperationsWe license and support proprietary technology to mortgage lenders in the UK. We also perform
certain of the Company's administrative and loan servicing functions through operations in India and Costa Rica. Our India operation also provides certain IT support and development services for the
Company. 

        Mortgage
banking is our core business, generating 50% of our revenues before provision for loan losses in 2007. We are a real-estate lending-centered company and have built
upon our mortgage banking operations in recent years to capitalize on meaningful related opportunities with the intent of stabilizing our consolidated earnings profile. For financial information about
our segments, see the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOperating Segment Results
section and Note 27Segments and Related Information in the financial statement section of this Report. 
 
 
Available Information     
        We have a Website located at www.countrywide.com on which we make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on
Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all exhibits and amendments to these reports available, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after such
material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC""). Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Code of Business Ethics, the charters of the committees
of our Board of Directors and all amendments and updates to these documents are also available on our Website and printed copies are available upon request. 
 
 
Loan Production     
        We produce residential and commercial mortgage loans within the Mortgage Banking, Banking and Capital Markets Segments. A significant amount of the mortgage loans
that we originate or purchase in our Mortgage Banking and Capital Markets Segments are sold into the secondary mortgage markets, primarily in the form of securities and to a lesser extent in the form
of loans. We generally perform the ongoing servicing functions related to the residential mortgage loans that we produce. Loans produced in our Banking Segment are generally held for investment. 
Types of Products  
        The majority of our loan production consists of Prime Mortgage Loans. Prime Mortgage Loans include conventional mortgage loans, loans insured by the Federal
Housing Administration (""FHA"") and loans guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (""VA""). A significant portion of the conventional loans we produce qualify for inclusion in guaranteed mortgage
securities backed by Fannie Mae or 
2



 

Freddie
Mac (""conforming loans""). Some of the conventional loans we produce either have an original loan amount in excess of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limit for single-family loans or
otherwise do not meet Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines. Loans that do not meet Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac guidelines are referred to as ""nonconforming loans."" In certain tables and elsewhere in
this Report, FHA and VA loans may be referred to as Government Loans. 
        We
have historically originated and purchased mortgage loans that generally fall into one of the following four categories: 


Prime Mortgage LoansThese are prime credit quality first-lien mortgage loans secured by
single-family residences. References to loans secured by single-family residences in this document include loans secured by one-to-four-dwelling-unit residential real estate.
Prime Home Equity LoansThese are prime credit quality second-lien mortgage loans, including home
equity lines of credit, secured by single-family residences.
Nonprime Mortgage LoansThese are first- and second-lien mortgage loans secured by single-family
residences, made to individuals with credit profiles that do not qualify them for a prime loan.
Commercial Real Estate LoansThese are prime credit quality mortgage loans secured by commercial properties, such
as apartment buildings, retail properties, office buildings, industrial sites, hotels and other commercial properties. 

        During
2007, secondary mortgage market demand for non agency-eligible loans (nonconforming Prime Mortgage Loans, Prime Home Equity Loans and Nonprime Mortgage Loans) was substantially
curtailed. Accordingly we revised our underwriting standards and product offerings to reflect these changes and de-emphasized non agency-eligible loans. 
        Total
loan production by segment and product, net of intersegment sales is summarized below:

Mortgage Banking Segment     
        Our Mortgage Banking Segment produces mortgage loans through a variety of channels on a national scale. The mortgage loans we produce in this segment are
generally sold into the secondary mortgage market, primarily in the form of securities, and to a lesser extent in the form of loans. We typically perform the ongoing servicing functions related to the
mortgage loans that we produce. We also provide various loan closing services such as escrow, flood determination and appraisal. Historically, mortgage banking loan production has occurred in
Countrywide Home Loans (""CHL""). Over the past several years, we have been transitioning this production to our bank subsidiary, Countrywide Bank, FSB (""Countrywide Bank"" or the ""Bank"").
As of December 31, 2007, over 90% of our monthly mortgage loan production occurred in Countrywide Bank. Effective January 1, 2008, our production channels have moved into the Bank,
completing the migration of substantially all of our loan production activities from CHL to the Bank. The mortgage loan production, the related balance sheet and the income relating to the holding and
sale of these loans is included in our Mortgage Banking Segment regardless of whether the activity occurred in CHL or Countrywide Bank. We group the activities of our Mortgage Banking Segment into
three business sectorsLoan Production, Loan Servicing and Loan Closing Services. 

 Loan Production  

        We source mortgage loans through three production channels: the Retail Channel (Consumer Markets and Full Spectrum Lending), the Wholesale Lending Channel and the
Correspondent Lending Channel. 

 Retail Channel  

        The Retail Channel consists of the Consumer Markets Division (""CMD"") and the Full Spectrum Lending Division (""FSLD""). CMD generally originates prime loans through
existing relationships with customers and organizations that influence the placement of mortgage services, while FSLD focuses on new customer acquisitions through Internet, direct mail and mass media
marketing channels. 
        For
2007, Countrywide was ranked by Inside Mortgage Finance as the third largest retail lender, in terms of volume, among residential
retail mortgage lenders nationwide. (Reprinted with the permission of Inside Mortgage Finance Inc. (""IMF"") Copyrighted. All rights reserved by IMF.) 

 Consumer Markets Division  

        CMD originates mortgage loans through three business groups: the Distributed Retail group, the Business-to-Consumer group and the
Strategic Business Alliances group. 
        The
Distributed Retail group is the branch network which originates loans through relationships with consumers, builders and Realtors® and through joint ventures. As of
December 31, 2007, this group consisted of 661 branch offices in 48 states and the District of Columbia. This group has a sales force of 6,136, which includes those dedicated to joint venture
relationships. The Distributed Retail group originated 72% of CMD's total volume for the year ended December 31, 2007. 
        The
Business-to-Consumer group primarily originates mortgage loans directly from existing customers through the Internet and through our call centers. The
Business-to-Consumer group focuses on customer retention through marketing and by providing our existing customers with an efficient and convenient means to obtain financing
for a new home, refinancing for their existing mortgage or a home equity loan. As of December 31, 2007, the Business-to-Consumer group consisted of five call centers
with a sales staff of 1,090. This group accounted for 26% of CMD's total volume for the year ended December 31, 2007. 
4



 
        The
Strategic Business Alliance group facilitates and manages the development of new sources of loans through relationships with organizations that influence the placement of mortgage
services. This group focuses primarily on developing revenue-sharing arrangements such as joint ventures, third party outsourcing, relocation lending, marketing service agreements and
brokered-in agreements. This group accounted for 2% (excluding Distributed Retail volume from joint venture relationships) of CMD's total volume for the year ended December 31,
2007. 

 Full Spectrum Lending Division  

        FSLD originates Prime Mortgage Loans with the primary focus on refinance and home equity products. FSLD operates through a network of 94 retail branch offices
located in 37 states, as well as four call
centers. The branches and call centers of FSLD are supported by two fulfillment centers for processing, underwriting and funding of these mortgage loans. FSLD also originated Nonprime Mortgage Loans
until Nonprime Mortgage Loan production was discontinued in late 2007. 
        FSLD's
mortgage production is generated through customer retention efforts directed to Countrywide's nonprime servicing portfolio and new customer acquisition through Internet, direct
mail and mass media marketing channels. FSLD also employed a network of sales associates who were dedicated to the fulfillment of referrals of Nonprime Mortgage Loan customers from CMD until late
2007. 

 Wholesale Lending Channel  

        Our Wholesale Lending Channel (""WLD"") underwrites and funds mortgage loans sourced by mortgage loan brokers and other financial intermediaries. WLD sources loans
through approximately 30,000 mortgage loan brokers nationwide. WLD offers a wide variety of Prime Mortgage Loans and Prime Home Equity Loan products. Business is solicited through a sales force, the
Internet and advertising. 
        As
of December 31, 2007, WLD operated 39 wholesale loan centers and three regional loan centers in various parts of the United States. WLD also originated Nonprime Mortgage Loans
until Nonprime Mortgage Loan production was discontinued in late 2007. 
        For
2007, Countrywide was ranked by Inside Mortgage Finance as the largest wholesale originator, in terms of volume, among residential
wholesale mortgage lenders nationwide. (Reprinted with the permission of IMF. Copyrighted. All rights reserved by IMF.) 

 Correspondent Lending Channel  

        Our Correspondent Lending Channel (""CLD"") purchases mortgage loans from other lenders, which include mortgage bankers, commercial banks, savings and loan
associations, home builders and credit unions. As of December 31, 2007, this Channel had correspondent relationships with approximately 1,760 lenders, who are subject to initial and ongoing
credit evaluation and monitoring. CLD operates in all 50 states. 
        For
2007, Countrywide was ranked by Inside Mortgage Finance as the largest correspondent lender, in terms of volume, among residential
correspondent mortgage lenders nationwide. (Reprinted with the permission of IMF. Copyrighted. All rights reserved by IMF.)

 Affordable and Multicultural Home Loan Programs  

        Since 1992, we have adopted a variety of affordable home loan initiatives designed to increase homeownership opportunities for low-to moderate-income
borrowers and communities and minority borrowers. Our long-time initiatives, known as the We House America® Initiatives,
supports affordable housing programs undertaken by Fannie Mae and promoted by various government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (""HUD""). 
        We
have specifically designed the House America® loan program to meet the needs of low-to moderate-income borrowers and others with financial, employment or
personal situations which might prevent them from qualifying for traditional mortgages. These loan programs enable such borrowers to qualify for a home loan by allowing, for example, lower down
payments, lower cash reserves, alternative income sources and more flexible underwriting criteria than on a typical loan program. The mortgage loans we produce through House America® are
sold and serviced on a non-recourse basis, generally through guarantee programs sponsored by Fannie Mae. 
        The
We House America® Initiatives include telephone-based counseling services provided by the House America Counseling Center
and Internet-based resources to educate prospective first-time minority and low-to moderate-income homebuyers about the home loan process. The House America®
counseling center also provides Spanish-speaking counselors and educational materials printed in both English and Spanish. 
        We
have made other significant commitments to affordable lending and multicultural markets initiatives designed to increase homeownership opportunities among minority and immigrant
communities. For example, we are approved to participate in more than 1,160 homebuyer assistance loan programs that assist borrowers with down payments and closing costs, which are offered by state,
county and city agencies, municipalities and not-for-profit organizations. In early 2005, we extended our five-year  We House America® Campaign, with a goal of originating $1.0 trillion in loans to
targeted

populations by the end of 2010. As of December 31, 2007, we made loans to 5.1 million borrowers and funded $827 billion (including Prime and Nonprime Mortgage Loans)
toward this goal. 

 Loan Servicing  

        When we sell or securitize mortgage loans, we generally retain the rights to service these loans. In servicing mortgage loans, we collect and remit loan payments,
respond to customer inquiries, account for principal and interest, hold custodial (impound) funds for payment of property taxes and insurance premiums, counsel delinquent mortgagors and supervise
foreclosures and property dispositions. We receive servicing fees and other remuneration in return for performing these functions. 

 Mortgage Servicing Rights, Retained Interests and the Servicing Hedge  

        We recognize the value of the servicing rights we retain when the servicing rights are contractually separated from the loans either through sale of the loans or
when the loans are securitized. The value we assign to servicing rights is referred to as mortgage servicing rights (""MSRs""). Our MSRs arise from contractual agreements between us and investors (or
their agents) in MBS and mortgage loans. We may also retain financial interests (""retained interests"") when we securitize mortgage loans. We include the value of these retained interests on our
balance sheet. The Loan Servicing Sector statement of operations includes the changes in value related to our MSRs and retained interests, as well as the revenues and expenses arising from servicing
the mortgage loans. Although MSRs generally arise from the sale or securitization of mortgage loans that we originate, we also occasionally purchase MSRs from others. For a more complete description
of MSRs, see Note 3Loan Sales in the financial statement section of this Report. 
        MSRs
and retained interests are generally subject to a loss in value when mortgage rates decline. To moderate the effect on earnings caused by a rate-driven decline in the
value of MSRs and retained interests, we maintain a portfolio of financial instruments, primarily derivative contracts, which generally increase in value when interest rates decline. This portfolio of
financial instruments is referred to as the ""Servicing Hedge."" See Note 4Derivative Financial InstrumentsRisk Management Activities Related to
Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) and Retained Interests in the financial statement section of this Report for a further discussion of our Servicing Hedge. 
Loan Servicing Operations  
        The various functions within our loan servicing operations are briefly described in the following paragraphs. These operations are performed primarily in nine
locations using the same systems and processes: two in California, three in Texas, one in Arizona, two in India and one in Costa Rica. 

 Customer Service  

        Our customer service call centers managed nearly 61 million contacts with customers in 2007. These contacts were primarily handled through our customer
service representatives, automated phone system and website (www.customers.countrywide.com). This division also prints monthly statements and oversees outbound customer correspondence. 

 Remittance Processing  

        Our Remittance Processing division processes all payments, loan payoffs and payoff demand statements. Approximately 48% of our customers make their monthly
payments electronically using various automated payment methods.

 Investor Accounting  

        Our Investor Accounting department reconciles custodial accounts, processes investor remittances and maintains accounting records on behalf of our mortgage
investors, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Government National Mortgage Association (""Ginnie Mae""), as well as private investors. 

 Home Retention  

        Our Home Retention unit works with delinquent borrowers to bring their mortgages back to current status and avoid foreclosure if possible. Our objective in the
loss mitigation process is to develop foreclosure prevention options that have the highest probability of successful resolution for the borrower and ultimately the investor. Countrywide uses multiple
tools to evaluate borrower needs and
reconcile them with investor guidelines in order to offer the borrower the most advantageous workout possible. These options include, but are not limited to: payment plans, payment forbearance, loan
modification, acceptance of deed to the collateral property in lieu of foreclosure and acceptance of the net proceeds from the borrower's sale of the property (also referred to as a short sale). 
        Loss
mitigation is most effective when we are able to establish early contact with the borrower. When a loan becomes delinquent, we attempt to communicate with our borrowers through
frequent outreach efforts throughout the collection process using tools such as brochures, housing fairs, counseling letters, telephone calls and DVD mailings. 
        When
contact is established with a borrower, Countrywide attempts to obtain information from the borrower relating to the borrower's financial condition and obtains an estimate of the
value of the property securing the loan. Based on this information, Countrywide assesses the borrower's short-term ability to reinstate the loan to current status and evaluates the options
available based on that assessment. If that is not possible, we determine what sort of assistance the borrower needs. This includes understanding their current debt to income ratio, as well as
analyzing the borrower's future ability to pay. Modification and payment capitalization transactions are focused on borrowers who have demonstrated the capacity and incentive to perform successfully
under the new terms of the loan. We have also developed loan modification programs designed to assist borrowers with refinancing their adjustable-rate mortgage (""ARM"") and pay-option ARM
loans before their loans reset. Alternative options such as short sales and acceptance of deeds in lieu of foreclosure are considered only after it has been determined that the borrower has no viable
ability to remain in the home. 
        These
efforts are tailored to the specific circumstances of a borrower and comply with the requirements of the mortgage investor. Our Home Retention division proactively works to
preserve homeownership by aligning with consumer advocacy groups, providing customer outreach and supporting early intervention. 

 Foreclosure and Bankruptcy  

        Foreclosure and bankruptcy are complex processes that are subject to federal and state laws and regulations, as well as mortgage investor and insurer
requirements. Our workflow-based systems facilitate consistent and compliant processing of defaulted mortgage loans, as well as an efficient flow of data between internal and external business
partners. We use our own companies in support of many of our foreclosure and bankruptcy activities to minimize related costs and to increase efficiency. 

 Related Services  

        We perform several loan servicing functions internally that other loan servicers commonly outsource to third parties. Our integrated services include performing
property tax payment processing, property inspections, and insurance tracking and premium payment processing. We believe the integration of these functions gives us a competitive advantage by lowering
overall servicing costs from

what
would otherwise be incurred and enabling us to provide a high level of service to our mortgage customers and mortgage investors.

(1)Expressed
as a percentage of the total number of loans serviced, excluding subserviced loans and loans purchased at a discount due to their collection status. 
        We
attribute the overall increase in delinquencies in our servicing portfolio from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007, to increased production of loans in recent years
with higher loan-to-value ratios and reduced documentation requirements, combined with a weakening housing market and significant tightening of available credit, and to
portfolio seasoning. Changing borrower profiles and trends toward higher initial combined loan-to-value ratios have made this impact most significant on nonprime delinquency.
We believe the delinquency rates in our servicing portfolio are consistent with rates for similar mortgage loan portfolios in the industry.

(1)Comparative
data not included for the year in which the state was not in the top five of our servicing portfolio. 

 Loan Closing Services Sector  

        We provide loan closing products and services such as credit reports, flood determinations, appraisals and title reports through our LandSafe, Inc. group
of companies. We provide these services primarily to customers referred by our loan production channels and our business units and also to third parties. 

 Competition and Consolidation  

        The mortgage lending industry is dominated by large, sophisticated financial institutions. To compete effectively, we must have a very high level of operational,
technological, and managerial expertise as well as access to capital at a competitive cost. As a result of reduced access to capital, general housing trends, rising delinquencies and defaults and
other factors, many mortgage lenders have recently experienced severe financial difficulty, with some exiting the business or filing for bankruptcy protection. Primarily because of these factors, the
industry continues its consolidation trend. 
 
 
Banking Segment     
        Our Banking Segment consists of the following operations: 


The
investment and fee-based activities of Countrywide Bank, FSB, a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (""FDIC"")-insured, federally-chartered savings bank
(""Banking Operations"")
Warehouse
lending through Countrywide Bank, FSB and Countrywide Warehouse Lending, a non-depository lending company that provides short-term secured
financing to mortgage lenders. 

11



 



 Countrywide Bank  
Banking
Operations 

        Our
Banking Operations primarily fund and purchase mortgage loans and home equity loans for investment purposes. The majority of these loans are sourced through our production channels.
For liquidity and asset-liability management purposes, we also invest in securities such as collateralized mortgage obligations and agency MBS. Banking Operations activities provide the Company with
an expanded product menu, lower cost funding sources and opportunities for a stable source of revenue in the form of net interest income. 
        Asset
growth is funded by the Bank's liability base. The Bank obtains retail deposits, primarily certificates of deposit, through 194 financial centers (163 of which are located in
CHL's retail branch offices) as of December 31, 2007, call centers and the Internet. Countrywide Bank also offers deposit accounts through deposit brokers (generally,
well-recognized financial intermediaries). 
        A
significant portion of Countrywide Bank's deposit liabilities are comprised of custodial funds that relate to our loan servicing portfolio. Countrywide Bank also offers commercial
deposit accounts to title and mortgage insurance companies through a commercial banking unit. The Bank also borrows funds from other sources to supplement its deposit liabilities, including mortgage
loan-secured borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (""FHLB"") of Atlanta and repurchase agreements secured by loans and securities. 
        Countrywide
Bank acts as a mortgage document custodian, primarily for our mortgage banking operations. As a document custodian, we verify, maintain and release collateral for issuers,
servicers,
sellers and purchasers of debt securitizations. We also provide other services, including safekeeping, collateral review/certification, collateral releases and customer reporting. 
        Properties
securing the residential mortgage loans in our Banking Operations' portfolio of loans held for investment are concentrated in the State of California. The following is a

 Countrywide Warehouse Lending  

        We provide committed and uncommitted lines of credit to mortgage bankers to finance their mortgage loan inventories, which we refer to as warehouse lending,
through both a non-depository lending company and Countrywide Bank. All of these mortgage bankers sell loans to our Mortgage Banking Segment's CLD. All of these advances are secured by
mortgage loans that have a market value in excess of the balance of our advances. 
12



 

 Competition  

        We operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition for retail deposits comes primarily from other insured depository institutions, which include more
than 7,300 commercial banks and almost 1,300 savings institutions. We attract and retain deposits through a combination of competitive rates, physical presence, experienced banking professionals and
easy access to our products through call centers and the Internet at www.countrywidebank.com. Because of our low-cost structure relative to other financial institutions, we are able to
offer deposit rates that are among the most competitive in the industry. 
        Countrywide
Bank invests primarily in adjustable-rate and short duration residential mortgage loans. Competition in making real estate loans comes principally from other
savings institutions, mortgage banking companies and commercial banks. The majority of loans that the Banking Segment invests in are sourced by our production channels. Countrywide Bank also competes
with commercial banks and investment banks in the purchase of loans from third parties. 
        Our
Banking Segment's competitive position is enhanced by its relationship with our Mortgage Banking Segment. For example, a significant portion of Countrywide Bank's deposit liabilities
consists of custodial funds directed by our Servicing Sector. As discussed above, Countrywide Bank obtains retail deposit products through financial centers placed within certain of CMD's retail
branch offices. This economical use of space reduces the Bank's deposit acquisition costs. 
 
 
Capital Markets Segment     
        Our Capital Markets Segment primarily operates as a registered securities broker-dealer, which is also a primary dealer of U.S. Treasury securities. We also
operate a residential mortgage loan manager, a commercial mortgage loan originator, a broker-dealer in Hong Kong, an introducing broker of futures contracts, an asset manager, and a broker of MSRs.
During 2007, we ceased the operations of broker-dealers in Japan and the United Kingdom and significantly downsized our trading of derivatives as a result of the market disruption. With the exception
of our commercial mortgage activities, we transact primarily with institutional customers, such as banks, other depository institutions, insurance companies, asset managers, mutual funds, pension
plans, other broker-dealers and governmental agencies. Customers of our commercial real estate finance business are the owners or sponsors of commercial properties, who can be individuals or
institutions. 
        Our
Capital Markets activities consist of the following: 

 Conduit  

        Conduit activities include the purchase, warehousing and ultimate disposition of residential mortgage loans on behalf of CHL. In our conduits, we manage both
Prime Mortgage Loans and Nonprime Mortgage Loans which are either acquired from third parties or originated in our Mortgage Banking Segment. We accumulate these loans for disposition either in the
form of securitizations or loan sales. We also manage the acquisition and disposition of delinquent or otherwise illiquid residential mortgage loans, some of which have been originated under FHA and
VA programs. We attempt to cure the loans, using the operations of our Servicing Sector, with the intent to securitize those loans that become eligible for securitization. The remaining loans are
serviced through foreclosure and
liquidation, which includes the collection of government insurance and guarantee proceeds relating to defaulted FHA and VA program loans. Our conduit activities have been severely constrained in the
latter part of 2007 amid significant turmoil in the U.S. mortgage market and the global capital markets. 
13



 

 Underwriting  

        Capital Markets participates in both competitive bid and negotiated underwritings and performs underwriting services for CHL, Countrywide Bank and third parties.
Underwriting activities may encompass the assumption of the market risk of buying a new issue of securities from the issuer and reselling the securities to investors, either directly or through
dealers. Capital Markets primarily underwrites mortgage-related debt securities and certificates of deposit. Capital Markets earns an underwriting spread that is the difference between the amount paid
to the issuer of securities and the offering price to investors, net of expenses. The spread earned on each transaction and the level of market risk assumed may vary based upon the nature of the
market and the terms of the underwriting agreement. Our underwriting activities have also been severely constrained in the latter part of 2007 as a result of the market disruption. 

 Securities Trading  

        Securities trading activities include the trading of debt securities in the secondary market after the original issuance of the security and, to a much lesser
extent, trading of derivative financial instruments. We generally trade mortgage-related fixed-income securities, including MBS, collateralized mortgage obligations and asset-backed securities (""ABS"")
issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and other financial institutions, including CHL. We also trade securities issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury and other governmental agencies. As a
result of the market disruption in 2007, our non agency trading activities have been significantly constrained. 

 Origination and Sale of Commercial Mortgage Loans  

        Capital Markets originates and sells commercial mortgage loans. Commercial mortgages are mortgages secured by commercial properties, such as apartment buildings,
retail properties, office buildings, industrial sites and hotels. As a result of the market disruption in 2007, our commercial lending activities have been significantly constrained. 

 Brokering  

        Brokering activities include brokerage, in an agent capacity, of residential mortgage loan transactions, MSRs and exchange traded futures and commodity options
contracts. The brokerage of residential mortgage loans, MSRs and futures and options contracts may be between third parties or between CHL or Countrywide Bank and third parties. 

 Asset Management  

        Asset management activities are conducted for the benefit of investors. This includes managing a private equity fund and a collateralized debt obligation. We
receive fees, including performance fees, for providing these services. We may also share in the results of the funds when we hold an investment interest in the fund. 

 Competition  

        The securities industry is both highly competitive and fragmented. In the mortgage securities market, we compete with global investment banks as well as regional
broker-dealers. We believe by leveraging the resources, contacts and knowledge of the Countrywide organization and by specializing in the mortgage securities market, we can offer information, products
and services tailored to the unique needs of institutional customers, giving us an advantage in the market. In contrast, many of our competitors offer a broader range of products and services and have
more reliable sources of liquidity, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.

        For
2007, according to Inside MBS & ABS, we ranked fourth among Non-Agency MBS Underwriters. 
 
 
Insurance Segment     
        Our Insurance Segment's primary activities are: 


Offering
property, casualty, life and disability insurance as an underwriter and as an insurance agent, offering insurance tracking services affiliated with our
lender-placed insurance programs and offering an array of commercial insurance products through our agency (""Insurance Operations"").
Providing
reinsurance coverage to primary mortgage insurers (""Reinsurance Operations""). 

        We
manage these activities through two business unitsBalboa Insurance Group and Balboa Reinsurance Company. 

 Insurance Operations  

        Our insurance operations include our insurance underwriters/carriers and their affiliated businesses, and our agency operations. 
        We
underwrite property, casualty, life and disability insurance in 50 states and the District of Columbia through the insurers that make up Balboa Insurance Group. Our retail insurance
products are offered by select general insurance agents serving the consumer market, including our insurance agency. 
        Our
insurance operations offer the following insurance product lines: 


Lender-Placed Property and AutomobileWe offer lender-placed real-property hazard insurance and
lender-placed automobile insurance. Such insurance is provided on behalf of mortgage and automobile lenders when borrowers fail to have agreed-upon insurance coverage in place to protect
the lender's security interest. We also provide insurance tracking services, which alert a lender when there is a lapse in a borrower's insurance, for almost 21.9 million loans, including
9.0 million loans serviced within our Mortgage Banking Segment.
Voluntary Homeowners and AutomobileWe underwrite retail homeowners and automobile insurance for consumers under
the Countrywide Insurance Group brand.
Life, Disability and CreditWe underwrite term life, credit disability and credit life insurance products. Our
retail insurance products are offered by select general insurance agents servicing the consumer market, including our affiliated agency. 

        Our
Insurance Operations' property and casualty division has received an ""A (Excellent)"" rating from A.M. Best Company, an insurance company rating and information service. Our
life insurance operations maintain an ""A- (Excellent)"" rating from A.M. Best Company. The ""Excellent"" rating is defined by the A.M. Best Company as having ""an excellent
ability to meet ongoing obligations to policy holders."" 
        Our
insurance agencies provide consumers, in particular our mortgage customers, with homeowners, life, disability, automobile and various other insurance products. Our insurance agencies

15



 

 Reinsurance Operations  

        We provide mortgage reinsurance to the insurance companies that provide primary mortgage insurance (""PMI"") on loans in our servicing portfolio. This reinsurance
covers losses in excess of a specified percentage of the principal balance of a given pool of mortgage loans, subject to a contractual limit, in exchange for a portion of the pools' mortgage insurance
premium. We provide this coverage with respect to substantially all of the loans in our portfolio that are covered by PMI, which generally includes all conventional loans with an original loan amount
in excess of 80% of the property's appraised value. 

 Competition  

        The lender-placed insurance market is dominated by a small number of providers, competing on policy terms and conditions, service, technological innovation,
compliance capability, loan tracking ability and price. 
        The
homeowners, automobile, term life, credit-life and credit-disability marketplaces are dominated by large, well-known providers. Consumers select such
insurance based on price, service and the efficiency and effectiveness of marketing and underwriting operations. 
        We
compete generally by providing high-quality service and pricing our products at competitive rates, as well as by leveraging our residential mortgage loan customer base. 
 
 
Global Operations Segment     
        The primary activities we conduct in our Global Operations Segment include: 


Software Licensing and SupportWe license and support proprietary technology to mortgage lenders in the UK.

(which also provides technology services for the Company) and one location in Costa Rica. 

 
 
Financing of Operations     

 Uses of Financing  

        We have significant financing needs. Our short-term financing needs arise primarily from the following: 


Warehousing
of mortgage loans pending sale
Trading
activities of our broker-dealer
Providing
mortgage warehouse credit to others. 

        Our
long-term financing needs arise primarily from the following: 


Investments
in mortgage loans
Investments
in MSRs and interests that we retain when we securitize mortgage loans
Financial
instruments acquired to manage the interest rate risk associated with our long-term investments in MSRs and financial instruments. 

16



 





 Sources of Financing  

        Recent disruptions in the public corporate debt and secondary mortgage markets have resulted in changes in our financing needs and how we finance our operations.
Before August 2007, a substantial portion of our financing needs was met by the issuance of unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper and by the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage
market, primarily in the form of MBS and ABS. The current lack of liquidity in those markets, particularly for non agency-eligible mortgage loans, has resulted in an increase in our financing needs as
we have to hold certain loans for longer periods of time pending sale and hold loans for investment that have become nonsalable due to market disruptions. To meet those increased needs, we took the
following actions: 


Accelerated
the integration of our mortgage banking activities into Countrywide Bank, which has more stable funding and more access to reliable sources of funds that are
less dependent on the capital markets during periods of market stress, providing more reliable liquidity
Significantly
changed our product offerings and underwriting guidelines, focusing our current loan production on loans that are available for direct sale to or
securitization into programs sponsored by the government-sponsored agencies (Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae)
Borrowed
$11.5 billion under unsecured revolving credit agreements
Arranged
$12.5 billion in new reliable secured borrowing capacity
Issued
$2.0 billion of 7.25% convertible cumulative preferred stock
Implemented
a campaign to attract and retain bank deposits, including significant expansion of our network of financial centers. 

        As
a result of these changes, our funding model more closely resembles that of a thrift holding company. We now meet our financing needs primarily through the following means: 


Deposit
gathering
FHLB
advances
Committed,
unsecured revolving lines of credit
Committed,
secured revolving lines of credit
Short-term
repurchase agreements
Unsecured
medium-term notes
Unsecured
subordinated debt and unsecured junior subordinated debentures, the latter of which includes high equity content debt securities
Retained
earnings. 

        We
use short-term deposits, unsecured revolving lines of credit, secured revolving lines of credit and repurchase agreements to finance a significant portion of our inventory
of mortgage loans held for sale and securities trading portfolio. Mortgage loans held for investment are financed with a combination of deposit liabilities and secured FHLB advances. 
        We
rely on the secondary mortgage market as a source of long-term capital to support our mortgage banking operations. In response to the recent decline in secondary mortgage
market liquidity for non agency-eligible mortgage loans, we have modified our product offerings such that the majority of loans we originate are eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie
Mae. At this time, virtually all non agency-eligible loans are being held on our balance sheet. 
17



 
        Our
strategy to ensure our ongoing access to the secondary mortgage market is to consistently produce quality mortgages and service those mortgages at levels that meet or exceed
secondary mortgage market standards. We make significant investments in personnel and technology to ensure the quality of our mortgage loan production. 
        While
the short-term public corporate debt markets are no longer a practical source of financing for us, access to the medium-term debt and equity markets will
remain an important source of financing to us when market conditions permit. Our continued access to those markets is dependent on maintaining investment-grade credit ratings. Investment grade ratings
are also important for counterparty retention and maintaining escrow deposits. Among other considerations, maintenance of our current investment-grade ratings requires that we have high levels of
liquidity, including access to alternative sources of funding such as deposits, FHLB advances and committed lines of credit provided by highly-rated banks. We also must maintain adequate capital that
meets or exceeds current rating agency requirements. We currently have investment grade ratings from all three rating agencies. 
        As
of December 31, 2007, our credit ratings are as follows:

(1)On
January 11, 2008, following the announcement of our pending acquisition by Bank of America, all three rating agencies placed our ratings on some form of positive watch to
reflect the likely upgrade to our ratings following completion of the Merger. 
        Our primary source of equity capital is retained earnings. We supplement our equity capital with subordinated debt and junior subordinated
debentures that receive varying degrees of ""equity treatment"" from rating agencies, bank lenders and regulators. From time to time, we may issue common stock or other debt securities that receive high
equity treatment as a means of supplementing our capital base and supporting our growth. To this end, during 2007, we issued $2.0 billion of preferred stock which ranks senior to our common
stock with respect to payment of dividends and distribution upon liquidation. 
        For
a further discussion of our liquidity and capital management see the section in this Report entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources.

 Interest Rate Risk  

        We typically bear interest rate risk from the time we commit to make a loan at a specified interest rate through the sale or repayment of the loan. We also bear
interest rate risk related to the interests we retain in the loans we sell, which are typically in the form of MSRs and retained interests, and to the extent that our loan and securities investment
portfolios' yields change on a different basis or at different times than the rates we pay on our borrowings. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk and how this risk is managed, see the
section in this Report entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk. 
18




 





 Credit Risk  

        One significant risk for the Company is credit risk, which is the risk that a borrower will not repay the loan's balance as agreed and the risk that the proceeds
from liquidation of the collateral securing the loan will not be adequate to repay the loan's balance. Historically, our primary source of credit risk has been the continuing investments and/or
obligations we retain either in the form of credit-enhancing subordinated interests, corporate guarantees or representations and warranties issued when we sell or securitize loans and through the
structure of certain of our securitizations. In addition, as our portfolio of investment loans has grown, our portfolio credit risk has also grown. We also have credit risk that a counterparty will
not perform in accordance with contractual terms and we will not realize uncollateralized gains that have been recorded. For a further discussion of our exposure to credit risk and how we manage this
risk, see the section in this Report entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCredit Risk
Management. 

 Operational Risk  

        Countrywide, like all large corporations, is exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders, unauthorized
transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunication systems. 
        For
a further discussion of our operational risk and how we manage this risk see the section in this Report entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of OperationsOperational Risk. 
 
 
Regulations     

 Regulations Applicable to Financial Institutions and their Holding Companies  
 General  

        As a savings and loan holding company, Countrywide is supervised and regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision (""OTS""), as is its federal savings bank
subsidiary, Countrywide Bank. Because it is an FDIC-insured institution, Countrywide Bank also is subject to regulation by the FDIC. Countrywide Bank's relationship with its depositors and
borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state laws, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Countrywide Bank's loan
documents. As a regulated financial services firm, our relationships and good standing with regulators are of fundamental importance to the continuation and growth of our businesses. The OTS, the SEC
and other regulators have broad enforcement powers and powers to approve, deny, or refuse to act upon our applications or notices to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets or
reconfigure existing operations. 
        There
are numerous rules governing the regulation of financial services institutions and their holding companies, including Countrywide and its subsidiaries, some of which are summarized
below. Accordingly, the following discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be complete or to describe all of the laws and regulations that apply to us. The laws and regulations should
be referenced for more information. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money
penalties, formal agreements, and cease and desist orders. 

 Regulations Applicable to Savings and Loan Holding Companies  

        Limitation on Activities: As a unitary savings and loan holding company, Countrywide is limited to business activities that are permitted under applicable
provisions of the Home Owners' Loan Act and regulations promulgated thereunder. 
19



 
        Regulatory
Capital Requirements: As a unitary savings and loan holding company, Countrywide is not subject to any regulatory capital requirements. However, the OTS expects savings and
loan holding companies to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company's business activities, and the risks inherent in those activities. Furthermore, Countrywide Bank, as a
federal savings association, is subject to OTS capital requirements as described further below under ""Federal Savings Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements."" 
        Enforcement:
The OTS has the power to take enforcement action against savings and loan holding companies and their affiliates to the extent that any action or business taken or conducted
by the holding company or affiliate threatens the safety, soundness or stability of the subsidiary insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or
cease and desist order, to removal of officers or directors of the institution, receivership, conservatorship, or the termination of deposit insurance. Civil money penalties may be imposed for a wide
range of violations and actions. 

 Regulations Applicable to Countrywide Bank as a Federal Savings Bank  

        General: As a federal savings bank, Countrywide Bank is subject to regulation and examination by the OTS. The Bank's deposits are insured by the Deposit Insurance
Fund of the FDIC to the extent provided by applicable federal law. The OTS is empowered to issue cease and desist orders against a federal savings bank if it determines that activities of the
institution represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation. The OTS has the power to impose upon federal savings banks and certain affiliated parties civil money
penalties for violations of banking statutes and regulations. In addition, the FDIC has the authority to recommend to the Director of the OTS that enforcement action be taken with respect to a
particular savings association. If action is not taken by the OTS, the FDIC has authority to take action under specified circumstances. These authorities are primarily intended to protect the
depositors of the federal savings bank and the Deposit Insurance
Fund of the FDIC, not shareholders or other creditors of the federal savings bank or its holding companies. 
        Federal
Savings Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements: The OTS regulations require savings associations to meet three minimum capital standards: at least: an 8% risk-based
capital ratio; a 4% leverage ratio (3% for institutions receiving the highest supervisory rating); and a 1.5% tangible capital ratio. The risk-based capital ratio is defined as the ratio
of total capital to risk-weighted assets. Risk-weighted assets include risk-weighted off-balance sheet activities, risk-weighted recourse
obligations, direct credit substitutes and certain other positions, all as computed in accordance with OTS regulations. The OTS' leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of core capital to adjusted
total assets. The tangible capital ratio is defined as the ratio of tangible capital (the components of which are very similar to those of core capital) to adjusted total assets. 
        In
addition to the foregoing, the OTS, the FDIC and other federal banking agencies possess broad powers under current federal law to take ""prompt corrective action"" in connection with
depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories for insured depository institutions: ""well capitalized,""
""adequately capitalized,"" ""undercapitalized,"" ""significantly undercapitalized,"" and ""critically undercapitalized."" To be considered ""well capitalized,"" an institution must maintain a Total
Risk-Based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 Risk-Based capital ratio of 6% or greater, a leverage capital ratio of 5% or greater, and not be subject to any
order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An ""adequately capitalized"" institution must have a Tier 1 Risk-Based capital ratio
of at least 4%, a Total Risk-Based capital ratio of at least 8%, and a leverage (or ""Tier 1"") capital ratio of at least 4%. 
20



 
        If
an institution fails to meet the adequate capitalization requirements, progressively more severe restrictions are placed on the institution's operations, management and capital
distributions, depending on the capital category in which an institution is placed. At December 31, 2007, Countrywide Bank exceeded the OTS regulatory capital requirements to be classified as
""well capitalized,"" with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.2% and a Total Risk-Based capital ratio of 14.4%. 
        Basel II
Capital Standards: We may be required to comply with, or decide to adopt, certain new capital and other regulatory requirements proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision, as proposed and to be implemented in the United States. The federal banking agencies have approved a final rule, effective April 1, 2008, to implement new risk-based
capital requirements in the United States. These new requirements, which are often referred to as the Basel II Accord, will, among other things, modify the capital charge applicable to credit
risk and incorporate a capital charge for operational risk. The Basel II Accord also places greater reliance on market discipline than current standards. The Basel II standards will be
mandatory with respect to banking organizations with total
banking assets of $250 billion or more or total on-balance-sheet foreign exposure of $10 billion or more. The threshold for mandatory adoption is determined by reference to
the federal savings bank subsidiary. Based on Countrywide Bank's total banking assets at December 31, 2007, Countrywide would not be required to adopt the Basel II standards.
Basel II's framework offers banks a choice of three methodologies for determining risk weights(1) a ""Standardized"" approach, (2) an advanced internal ratings-based approach,
and (3) an advanced measurements approach. Mandatory organizations will have to use Basel II's most advanced methods only. 
        Organizations
that do not meet the size criteria of a mandatory organization may choose voluntarily to comply with the more advanced requirements specified under the new capital
framework and are called ""opt in"" organizations. Institutions that choose not to opt in will continue to operate under existing risk-based capital rules, subject to any changes made to
those standards. 
        The
banking agencies have issued a proposal that would allow the voluntary adoption of the Standardized approach to offer general organizations a set of regulatory capital requirements
that have more risk sensitivity than the current Basel I rules, but less complexity than the Basel II advanced standards. The federal banking regulatory agencies are considering revised
capital standards that would apply to all financial institutions that are not subject to the Basel II Accord (""Basel 1A""), with the expressed intention to align those standards more closely
with those that would be applicable to Basel II institutions. At this time, Countrywide cannot predict the final form the optional Basel II Standardized approach will take, when it will
be implemented, the effect that it might have on Countrywide Bank's financial condition or results of its operations, or how these effects might impact Countrywide Financial Corporation. We are
monitoring the evolution of the Basel II Standardized approach, whether we will be required or elect to adopt Basel II, its potential impact on the Bank, Countrywide Financial
Corporation and the industry at large. If Countrywide Financial Corporation adopts the Basel II Advanced approach, voluntarily or mandatorily, or the Basel II Standardized approach, the
Basel II Accord requirements would replace existing risk-based capital requirements, but not the leverage capital requirements imposed under U.S. law and regulation. 
        Qualified
Thrift Lender Test: As a federal savings bank, Countrywide must comply with the Qualified Thrift Lender (""QTL"") Test. The QTL Test requires that a savings
association, including a federal savings bank, have assets designated as ""qualified thrift investments"" constituting no less than 65% of its ""portfolio assets"" in at least nine months of the most
recent 12-month period. ""Portfolio assets"" generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of certain specified assets. Qualified thrift investments are defined to
include residential mortgage lending assets and certain consumer and small business related assets. If an institution does not meet the QTL Test, it may be precluded from interstate branching and
engaging in any new activities, and may be subject to certain other restrictions. 
21



 
        Deposit
Insurance and Assessments: The FDIC insures deposit accounts in Countrywide Bank generally up to a maximum of $100,000 per separately-insured depositor, and up to a maximum of
$250,000 per separately-insured depositor for certain retirement accounts. The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system to determine assessment rates to be paid by member institutions such
as the Bank. In addition, the FDIC collects funds from insured institutions sufficient to pay interest on debt obligations of the Financing Corporation. The Financing Corporation is a
government-sponsored entity that was formed to borrow the money necessary to carry out the closing and ultimate disposition of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The
current annual rate established by the FDIC for the Financing Corporation assessment is 1.14 basis points. 
        Loans
to One Borrower: Federal law imposes restrictions on the amount of loans that a federal savings bank can lend to one borrower. The maximum amount that a federal savings bank may
loan to one borrower generally is limited to 15% of the bank's capital, plus an additional 10% for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral, as such term is defined in applicable
regulation. 
        Limitations
on Transactions with Affiliates: Countrywide Bank is subject to restrictions on transactions with affiliates that are the same as those applicable to commercial banks under
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as well as certain additional restrictions imposed on federal savings associations by the Home Owners' Loan Act. The term ""affiliate"" under
these laws means any company that controls or is under common control with a savings association and includes Countrywide and its non-bank subsidiaries. Transactions between Countrywide
Bank and certain affiliates are restricted to an aggregate percentage of Countrywide Bank's capital, and where required must be collateralized with certain specified assets. Permissible transactions
with affiliates must be on terms that are at least as favorable to the savings association as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. 
        Countrywide
Bank also is restricted in its ability to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, to the
same extent as such restrictions apply to commercial banks. 
        Payment
of Dividends: As a federal savings bank, the Bank is subject to the provisions of the OTS regulations and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (""FDIA"") relating to dividends and it
is not permitted to pay dividends if it is undercapitalized or if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized. The OTS has prescribed that the Company and its affiliates are not authorized to
receive, and Countrywide Bank is not authorized to pay the Company or its affiliates, capital distributions without receipt of prior written OTS non-objection. 
        Bank
Secrecy Act: Countrywide Bank is subject to extensive anti-money laundering provisions and requirements, which require the institution to have in place a comprehensive
customer identification program and an anti-money laundering program and procedures. These laws and regulations also prohibit financial institutions from engaging in business with foreign
shell banks; require financial institutions to have due diligence procedures and, in some cases, enhanced due diligence procedures for foreign correspondent and private banking accounts; and improve
information
sharing between financial institutions and the U.S. government. Countrywide Bank has established polices and procedures intended to comply with these provisions. 
        Community
Reinvestment Act (""CRA""): The Bank is subject to the CRA and implementing regulations. CRA regulations establish the framework and criteria by which the bank regulatory
agencies assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of its community, including low- and moderate- income neighborhoods. The OTS is required to assess a saving
association's record of compliance with the CRA, and to assign one of four possible ratings to an institution's CRA performance, including ""outstanding,"" ""satisfactory,"" ""needs to improve,"" and
""substantial noncompliance."" CRA ratings are taken into account by regulators in reviewing certain applications made by the Company and its banking subsidiaries. A savings association's failure to
comply with the 
22



 

provisions
of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities. As of December 31, 2007, Countrywide Bank's CRA rating was ""satisfactory."" 
        Fair
Lending Laws: The Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in
those statutes. A savings association's failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OTS, as well as other federal
regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 
        Federal
Home Loan Bank System: Countrywide Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, which is one of the 12 regional banks in the FHLB System. The primary purpose of the
FHLBs is to provide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for making affordable housing and community development lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta,
Countrywide Bank is required to acquire and hold FHLB shares in an amount at least equal to 0.2% of Countrywide Bank's assets, up to a maximum of $25.0 million, plus 4.5% of total FHLB
advances. 

 Other Regulations Applicable to Countrywide Bank  

        Regulation of Other Activities: The investments and activities of the Bank as a federally chartered savings bank are also subject to regulation by federal banking
agencies with respect to: 


Investments
in subsidiaries
Investments
for the Bank's account (including limitations on investments)
Unsecured
commercial paper and medium-term notes
Security

        Interagency
Statement on Subprime Mortgage Lending: On July 10, 2007, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final interagency statement to address issues and questions
related to certain subprime mortgage products and lending practices. The guidance addresses concerns with so called ""2/28,"" ""3/27,"" and similar ARMs that can expose borrowers to significant payment
shock once introductory rates expire. The statement set forth expectations for sound lending practices and clear communications with borrowers, addressing, among other things, the following lending
practices of concern: (1) initial payments based on an introductory interest rate that is substantially lower than the fully-indexed rate, (2) very high or no limits on payment or
interest-rate increases, (3) limited documentation of a borrower's income, and (4) substantial prepayment penalties and/or prepayment penalties that extend beyond the initial
interest rate adjustment period. The statement also addresses concerns that borrowers may not be adequately informed of the product features, material loan terms, 
23



 

and
product risks by stating that communications with consumers should provide clear and balanced information about the relative benefits and risks of such products. The statement supplements the
Interagency Guidance on Nontraditional Mortgage Product Risks issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies on residential mortgage products that allow borrowers to defer repayment of principal
and/or interest, including ""interest-only"" mortgage loans and ""payment option"" adjustable-rate mortgages, that have the potential for negative amortization. The guidance
requires that an institution's management assess a borrower's ability to repay the loan, including any additional principal balances resulting from negative amortization which occurs when deferred
interest payments are added to the principal balance. In particular, the guidance requires that for all nontraditional mortgage loan products, an institution's analysis of a borrower's repayment
capacity should include an evaluation of the ability to repay the debt at final maturity at the fully indexed rate, assuming a fully amortizing repayment schedule. In addition, for products that
permit negative amortization, the repayment analysis should be based upon the initial loan amount plus any balance increase that may accrue from the negative amortization features. The guidance
contains further steps which must be taken with respect to loans that have additional risk-layering features, such as reduced documentation programs and simultaneous second liens. The
guidance also articulates portfolio management measures that should be taken by institutions that originate or invest in nontraditional mortgage products. Finally, the guidance also requires that
financial institutions provide customers sufficient information to clearly understand the loan terms and associated risks prior to a customer's choosing a nontraditional mortgage product. 

 Proposed Federal and State Laws and Regulations  

        Various legislation, including proposals to change substantially the financial institution regulatory system, is from time to time proposed for adoption.
Currently, there are a number of proposed and recently enacted federal, state and local laws and regulations and guidance addressing mortgage lending and servicing practices. Congress is considering
several bills to combat abuses in the mortgage lending market and to provide substantial new protections to mortgage consumers. While it is not possible to predict which of these bills may pass, key
provisions of the bills under consideration would: 


establish
a federal duty of care owed by mortgage originators to mortgage applicants and borrowers
prohibit
steering of borrowers into subprime loans if they qualify for prime loans
establish
minimum federal standards for licensing or registration of mortgage originators, including brokers and bank loan officers
establish
minimum underwriting standards for all mortgages, including requiring lenders to determine that borrowers have a reasonable ability to repay and that loans provide
borrowers a tangible net benefit
extend
limited liability to secondary market securitizers who acquire, package and sell interest in home mortgage loans that do not meet these standards
establish
new loan servicing and appraisal standards, and imposes penalties for violations of these standards
expand
and enhance consumer protections for certain ""high-cost loans."" 

        Also,
Congress is considering changes to federal bankruptcy laws that would, if passed, allow judges presiding in Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases to modify the terms of mortgages
secured by a borrower's principal residence, including but not limited to, the interest rate, loan maturity and principal balance. 
        In
addition to these consumer protection efforts, Congress is also considering expanding federal housing finance programs to address liquidity concerns and improve consumer access to

Legislation to reform the FHA's home loan programs has passed both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate. The bills would lower down payment requirements and increase FHA loan
limits in high cost markets. Congress may also attempt to pass legislation to reform oversight of the government sponsored enterprises that would include provisions to increase the loan limits for
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in high cost areas. These efforts may proceed notwithstanding recent enactment of ""economic stimulus"" legislation that included temporary loan limit increases. 
        At
the state level, legislation building on the passage of mortgage lending restrictions in 2007 in states such as Minnesota, Maine, and North Carolina may appear in a number of
jurisdictions. State bills attempting to establish new consumer protections governing loan servicing practices and foreclosure procedures also are expected in 2008. 
        The
Federal Reserve Board also has proposed changes to Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) to protect consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive home mortgage lending and advertising
practices. The proposal includes four key protections for ""higher-priced mortgage loans"" secured by a consumer's principal dwelling: (1) creditors would be prohibited from engaging in a pattern
or practice of extending credit without considering a borrower's ability to repay the loan; (2) creditors would be required to verify the income and assets they rely upon in making a loan;
(3) prepayment penalties would only be permitted if certain conditions are met, including the condition that no penalty will apply for at least sixty days before any possible payment increase;
and (4) creditors would have to establish escrow accounts for taxes and insurance. In addition, the following protections would apply to all loans secured by a consumer's principal dwelling,
regardless of the loan's APR: (a) lenders would be prohibited from making payments, directly or indirectly, to mortgage brokers, including through ""yield-spread premiums"" unless the broker
previously entered into a written agreement with the consumer disclosing the broker's total compensation and other facts; (b) creditors and mortgage brokers would be prohibited from coercing a
real estate appraiser to misstate a home's value; and (c) companies that service mortgage loans would be prohibited from engaging in certain practices. While the final form of the rules cannot
be predicted, it is expected the Federal Reserve Board will issue final regulations by mid-2008. 
        Finally,
the U.S. Treasury Department convened meetings of the major mortgage servicers and mortgage securities investors in late 2007. The group developed and has begun implementing a
framework for modifying certain first-lien subprime residential ARMs to provide a five-year extension of their starter interest rates. The plan applies to subprime
residential adjustable rate mortgages originated between January 1, 2005 and July 31, 2007, which: (1) have an initial fixed rate period of 36 months or less;
(2) face an initial interest rate reset between January 1, 2008 and July 31, 2010; and (3) are currently included in securitized pools. Borrowers are eligible for the
five-year extension if they are current in their mortgages, and are determined to not be able to afford the reset mortgage and meet certain other established criteria that will allow a
streamlined assessment of the likelihood of default. However, in the face of concerns about increasing delinquency and foreclosure rates and the pace of industry loss mitigation efforts, this
voluntary plan may be revised and/or federal and state mandates may emerge that impose additional or different loss mitigation and servicing requirements. 
        In
general, there are a number of federal and state proposals that could impose new loan disclosure requirements; restrict or prohibit certain loan terms, fees and charges such as
prepayment penalties; may require borrower counseling; and increase penalties for non-compliance. We cannot reasonably predict the final content of the legislative proposals, if any, that
will be enacted or the regulatory proposals, if any, that will be adopted. Therefore, we cannot predict the potentially adverse impact that they, or any implementing regulations, could have on the
Company's business, results of operations or financial condition. We also cannot reasonably predict the impact that the U.S. Treasury Department plan, subsequent revisions, or other loss mitigation
and servicing proposals could have on the Company.

 Other Regulations Applicable to Us and Our Non-Bank Subsidiaries  

        Our non-bank subsidiaries are subject to supervision by the OTS and may be subject to the supervision of, and regulation and licensure by, other state
and federal regulatory agencies. In addition, certain federal, agency and state laws apply to specific business segment activities, whether performed by Countrywide Bank or the non-bank
subsidiaries. 
        In
addition, we are subject to a number of federal, state and local laws aimed at protecting a consumer's privacy. Generally, privacy laws cover a wide range of issues including limiting
a company's ability to share information with third parties or affiliates, providing stronger identity theft protection, victim's assistance programs and security breach notification, providing the
ability to avoid telemarketing solicitations through ""do-not-call"" lists, and limiting e-mail and fax advertising. These laws also impose penalties for
non-compliance. 

 Mortgage Banking Segment  

        Our mortgage banking business is subject to the rules, regulations or guidelines of, and/or examination or investigation by, the following entities with respect
to the processing, originating, selling and servicing of mortgage loans: 


The
OTS
HUD
The
FHA
The
Department of Veteran Affairs
Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae
The
Federal Trade Commission
State
regulatory authorities and Attorneys General
Regulation AB
of the SEC. 


        The
rules, regulations and requirements of these entities, among other things, impose licensing obligations on the Company or its subsidiaries; establish standards for advertising as
well as processing, underwriting and servicing mortgage loans and appraisal practices; prohibit discrimination; restrict certain loan features in some cases and fix maximum interest rates and fees in
some states. 
        As
an FHA lender, we are required to submit to the FHA Commissioner, on an annual basis, audited financial statements. Ginnie Mae, HUD, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac require the maintenance
of specified net worth levels (which vary among the entities). Our affairs are also subject to examination by the Federal Housing Commissioner to assure compliance with FHA regulations, policies and
procedures. 
        Mortgage
origination activities are subject to the Fair Housing Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Truth-in-Lending Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real
Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act and the regulations promulgated under those statutes, as well as other federal laws and other regulations. These laws
prohibit discrimination, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit terms and settlement costs, prohibit referral fees and require the maintenance and
disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution, income level and annual percentage rate over certain thresholds. 
26



 

 Capital Markets Segment  

        Securities broker-dealer operations in the United States are subject to federal and state securities laws, as well as the rules of the SEC and the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. Our securities broker-dealer operations in Hong Kong are subject to the rules of the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong. Our introducing futures broker is
regulated by the National Futures Association, the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. State, federal and foreign securities laws govern many aspects of a
broker-dealer's business, including the maintenance of required levels of capital, the establishment of segregated cash or securities accounts for the benefit of customers, the monthly and annual
reporting of operating and financial data to regulators, the approval and documentation of trading activity, the retention of records and the governance of the manner in which business may be
conducted with customers. Our discontinued broker-dealer operations in Japan were subject to the regulations of the Financial Services Agency of Japan and the Japan Securities Dealers Association. The
operations of our discontinued securities broker-dealer in the United Kingdom were subject to the regulation of the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom. Commercial loan originations are
subject to the licensing and regulations of various individual states. 

 Insurance Segment  

        Countrywide, by virtue of its ownership of insurance companies, is a member of an insurance holding company group pursuant to the provisions of the Insurance
Holding Company Acts (collectively the ""Holding Company Acts""). The insurance company entities are subject to the various state insurance departments' broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative
powers. These powers relate primarily to: the standards of capital and solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature and limitation of insurers'
investments; the approval of rates, rules and forms; the issuance of securities by insurers; periodic examinations of the affairs of insurers; and the establishment of reserves required to be
maintained for unearned premiums, losses and other purposes. 
        Pursuant
to the Holding Company Acts, the Company must provide state insurance departments with certain financial information. In addition, certain transactions specified by the Holding
Company Acts may not be effected without the prior notice and/or approval of the applicable insurance department. Examples of transactions that may require prior approval include, but are not limited
to, sales, purchases, exchanges, loans and extensions of credit, and dividends and investments between the insurance company entity and other entities within the holding company group. 

 Taxation  

        Countrywide files a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined income tax return in California and certain other states. Additional income tax
returns are filed on a separate entity basis in various other states and localities. 
        Deferred
taxes are provided for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company's primary temporary difference
relates to its investment in MSRs created upon the sale of mortgage loans. According to the Internal Revenue Code and related administrative guidance, substantially all of the Company's gain on sale
of loans is recognized in future periods as servicing fee income is earned. 
        Countrywide
is generally subject to California's higher income tax rate for financial corporations in lieu of having to pay certain state and local personal property and other taxes that
are paid by non-financial corporations. The statutory financial corporation tax rate was 10.84% for 2007 and 2006. The Company apportions taxable income to the various states in which it
does business based on its level of business activity in those states, which is determined primarily by reference to payroll costs, 
27



 

revenues
and property (including loans outstanding). Among the many factors that the Company considers in determining where to conduct its business activities are prevailing state income tax rates. 
        As
a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and other tax authorities. The Internal Revenue Service has examined Countrywide's tax returns for tax years
through 2004, and is currently examining 2005 and 2006. The Company is currently under examination for tax years 2003 and 2004 by the California Franchise Tax Board, which has previously audited tax
years through 2001. Management believes it has adequately provided for potential tax liabilities that may be assessed for years in which the statute of limitations remains open.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors  
Forward-Looking Statements  

 Factors That May Affect Our Future Results  

        We make forward-looking statements in this Report and in other reports we file with the SEC and in press releases. Our management may make forward-looking
statements orally in a public forum to analysts, investors, the media and others. Generally, forward-looking statements include: 


Projections
of our revenues, income, earnings per share, capital structure or other financial items
Descriptions
of our plans or objectives for future operations, products or services
Forecasts
of our future economic performance, interest rates, profit margins and our share of future markets
Descriptions
of assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing. 

        Forward-looking
statements give management's expectation about the future and are not guarantees. Words like ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""promise,"" ""plan"" and other expressions or
words of similar meanings, as well as future or conditional verbs such as ""will,"" ""would,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" or ""may"" are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. There are a number
of factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause actual results to differ significantly from management's expectations. Some of these factors are discussed below. 
        Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update them to
reflect changes that occur after the date they are made. 

 General business, economic, market and political conditions may significantly affect our earnings  

        Our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. These conditions include short-term and
long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets, and the strength of the U.S. economy, as well as the local economies in which we conduct
business. 
        Our
business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the
Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. The Federal Reserve Board's policies influence the size of the mortgage origination market, which
significantly impacts the earnings of our Loan Production Sector and the value of our investment in MSRs and retained interests. The Federal Reserve Board's policies also influence the yield on our
interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and can have a material effect on the Company's
business liquidity, results of operations and financial condition. 
        Political
conditions can also impact our earnings. Acts or threats of war or terrorism, as well as actions taken by the U.S. or other governments in response to such acts or threats,
could impact business and economic conditions in the United States. 

 Our decision to retain more loans in our portfolio of loans held for investment has increased our credit exposure and could increase our exposure to additional credit losses  

        As a result of disruptions in the debt and secondary mortgage market conditions, we have retained, and expect to continue to retain, more loans in our portfolio
held for investment or to hold additional loan or security inventory until market conditions improve. In 2007, we increased our 
37



 
portfolio
of loans held for investment by 28.1% to $100.4 billion, compared to $78.3 billion in 2006. These factors may expose us to higher credit losses compared to the past due to a
higher proportion of loans held for investment, and may expose us to the potential of increased loan delinquencies and defaults and further write-downs of loans in our held for investment portfolio. 

 We may continue to experience increased credit losses due to downward trends in the economy and in the real estate market and increases in delinquency rates of borrowers  

        Significant disruptions in the U.S. mortgage market and global capital market conditions caused us to reduce our loan products offered, tighten underwriting
standards and adjust loan pricing. These actions, along with those of other mortgage lenders, had the effect of reducing the availability of mortgage credit to borrowers. This lack of mortgage credit
contributed to a weakening of the housing market and may have contributed to the significant increase in the number of homeowners who became delinquent on their home loans. Continued disruptions in
the U.S. mortgage market and global capital market conditions and additional weakening in the housing market could further depress mortgage loan performance and continue to increase our credit costs. 
        Another
factor that may contribute to higher delinquency and default rates is the increase in monthly payments on adjustable rate mortgage loans. Any increase in prevailing market
interest rates may result in increased payments for borrowers who have adjustable rate mortgage loans. Moreover, with respect to hybrid mortgage loans after their initial fixed rate period, and with
respect to mortgage loans with a negative amortization feature which reach their negative amortization cap, additional borrowers will experience a substantial increase in their monthly payment even
without an increase in prevailing market interest rates. The increase in the monthly payment amount increases the risk that borrowers will become delinquent and ultimately default on their loans. 
        Our
profitability in our Mortgage Banking, Banking and Capital Markets Segments is impacted by the ability of our customers to repay their loans. Our Banking Segment is impacted if the
borrowers in
their portfolio of loans held for investment are unable to repay their loans. The Mortgage Banking and Capital Markets Segments are impacted by the credit risk that we retain when we sell the loans
that we produce. When we sell loans, we retain credit risk in the form of subordinated mortgage-backed securities, including residual and mezzanine securities, and through the representations and
warranties made to the issuing trusts for mortgage-backed securities issued by us or purchasers of loans we have sold, through the issuance of corporate guarantees and through the cash flow
prioritization structure of certain securitizations. A significant portion of our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities consists of subordinated securities that absorb all or a disproportionately
high percentage of the losses realized on the loans in the related mortgage pool. The buyers of our loans are expected to make more claims against our corporate guarantees and mortgage loan
representations and warranties if more of our borrowers default on their loans. Higher borrower defaults can also lead to reprioritization of cash flow in certain of our securitizations that
subordinate our rights to cash from the securitizations. While we estimate and provide for credit losses accruing to our portfolio of loans held for investment and mortgage-backed securities and
record liabilities for our obligations, worsening economic and real estate market conditions could further negatively impact our allowance for loan losses, the fair value of the mortgage-backed
securities we retain and increase our liabilities. 
        Part
of our strategy to mitigate credit exposure is to obtain mortgage insurance coverage. Although we purchase credit enhancement from those mortgage insurance providers that have an
AA- rating or equivalent from the credit rating agencies, our credit losses would increase if the mortgage insurance companies were unable to fulfill their contractual obligations. 
38



 

 Disruptions in our sources of financing and continued disruption in the secondary mortgage market could continue to adversely impact our earnings and financial condition  

        We have significant financing needs that we historically have met through the capital markets, including the debt and secondary mortgage markets. These markets
are currently experiencing unprecedented disruptions, which have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the Company's earnings and financial condition. Current conditions in the debt
markets, which have increased the cost and significantly reduced the availability of debt, may continue or worsen in the future. 
        Since
we are highly dependent on the availability of credit to finance our operations, a reduction in available credit or other financing sources, such as through the FHLB or from
deposits to Countrywide Bank, could have an adverse impact on our earnings and financial condition, particularly in the short term. If we were restricted from obtaining additional advances from the
FHLB or unable to pledge certain assets that we have historically pledged, it could adversely affect our liquidity and operations. 
        The
secondary mortgage markets are also currently experiencing unprecedented disruptions resulting from reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities and
increased investor yield requirements for those loans and securities. These conditions may continue or worsen in the future. A prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may continue to impact
our loan production volumes and could have an adverse impact on our future earnings and financial condition through reduced loan margins. 

 Dependence on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Relationships  

        We have substantial relationships with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including loan sale and servicing arrangements that are material to our business. A significant
portion of the conventional loans that we originate or purchase qualify for inclusion in guaranteed mortgage securities backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. We also derive other material financial
benefits from these relationships, including the government-sponsored enterprises (""GSEs"") assumption of credit risk on loans included in such securities in exchange for payment of guarantee fees;
benefits to revenues and liquidity from escrow and account funds deposited with Countrywide Bank and other financial institutions, and the avoidance of certain loan inventory finance costs through
streamlined loan funding and sale procedures. A substantial reduction in the volume of loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac agree to purchase or the loss of our servicing rights or the other material
financial benefits we receive from these entities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition. 
        As
government-sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are subject to extensive regulation and oversight by governmental agencies. Changes in the manner in which the GSEs
conduct business in the marketplace or with Countrywide in particular could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or prospects. Changes in regulations or the occurrence of other
events that adversely impact the business, operations or prospects of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations or prospects. 

 It we were to suffer a significant credit rating downgrade, it could have a substantial adverse impact on our operations  

        Three credit rating agencies follow Countrywide. Moody's Investor Services has assigned us an investment grade rating of Baa3, which is the lowest investment
grade rating, while Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's have each assigned us an investment grade rating of BBB+. As of December 31, 2007, all three credit rating agencies had placed us
on some form of negative outlook. These ratings reflect the credit agencies' concern that continued stresses in the mortgage markets will continue to present financial challenges for us in the near
term. If we were to be downgraded by any of these 
39



 
ratings
agencies and lose our investment grade rating, such downgrade could potentially result in the acceleration of certain secured debt obligations and adversely affect our ability to conduct
trading applicable to the management and hedging of our MSR assets, retained interests, inventory of loans, commitments to originate and purchase loans and our broker-dealer operations. Additionally,
such downgrade would increase our financing costs and have a potential negative impact on our ability to attract and retain bank deposits. 
        If
the Bank were to lose its investment grade rating, it could adversely affect its ability to hold custodial accounts on deposits and retain commercial deposits. As of
December 31, 2007, up to $4.2 billion of our custodial deposits may be subject to placement with another bank if the Bank's credit rating was reduced below investment grade. 

 The volatility of interest rates may significantly affect our earnings  

        The level and volatility of interest rates significantly affect the mortgage industry. For example, a decline in mortgage rates has historically increased the
demand for home loans as borrowers refinance, but also has historically led to accelerated payoffs in our mortgage servicing portfolio, which has negatively impacted the value of our MSRs. 
        We
attempt to manage interest rate risk in our mortgage banking business primarily through the natural counterbalance of our loan production and servicing operations. In addition, we
also use derivatives extensively to manage the interest rate, or price, risk inherent in our assets, liabilities and loan commitments. Our main objective in managing interest rate risk is to moderate
the impact of changes in interest rates on our earnings over time; however, our interest rate risk management strategies may result in significant earnings volatility in the short term. The success of
our interest rate risk management strategies is largely dependent on our ability to predict the earnings sensitivity of our loan servicing and loan production operations in various interest rate
environments. There are many
market factors that impact the performance of our interest rate risk management activities including interest rate volatility, the shape of the yield curve and the spread between mortgage interest
rates and Treasury or swap rates. The success of this strategy impacts our net income. This impact, which can be either positive or negative, can be material. 

 The industries in which we operate are highly competitive  

        We operate in highly competitive industries that could become even more competitive as a result of economic, legislative, regulatory and technological changes.
Competition to produce mortgage loans comes primarily from large commercial banks, savings institutions and investment banks. 
        We
face competition in such areas as mortgage product offerings, rates and fees, and customer service, both at the retail and institutional level. In addition, technological advances and
heightened e-commerce activities have increased consumers' accessibility to products and services generally. This has intensified competition among banking as well as nonbanking companies
in offering financial products and services. 

 Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings  

        Reputation risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative public opinion, is inherent in our business. Negative public opinion can result
from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in
response to those activities. Negative public opinion can also result from media coverage, whether accurate or not. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain
customers, trading counterparties and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action. Because virtually all of our businesses operate under the ""Countrywide"" brand, actual or alleged
conduct by one business can result in negative public 
40



 
opinion
about other Countrywide businesses. Although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our customers and communities, as a large diversified financial services company with a
relatively high industry profile, this risk will always be present in our organization. 

 Our failure to comply with federal, state or local laws or regulations or any examination downgrade could adversely impact our operations, growth or profitability  

        Our failure to comply with any federal, state and local laws or regulations, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential
litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments, any of which could adversely affect our earnings. Any failure to comply with such applicable laws and regulations also could result
in a range of sanctions and enforcement actions, including the imposition of civil money penalties, formal agreements, and cease and desist orders. 
        Countrywide
and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by regulators such as the OTS, which results in examination reports and supervisory ratings (which are not publicly available)
that can impact the conduct and growth of our businesses. Our supervisory ratings are based on compliance with applicable laws and regulations, capital levels, asset quality and risk, management
ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors. A supervisory rating downgrade by any of our federal bank regulators potentially can result in the imposition of significant
limitations on our activities and growth. These regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies
determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies
of these agencies. This supervisory framework could materially impact the conduct, growth, and profitability of our operations. 

 Changes in legal, regulatory and legislative environments in which we operate could adversely impact our business  

        We are regulated by banking, mortgage lending and insurance laws at the federal, state and local levels, and proposals for further regulation of the financial
services industry are continually being introduced. We also are subject to many other federal, state and local laws and regulations that affect our business, including those regarding taxation and
privacy. Congress and state legislatures, as well as federal and state regulatory agencies and local governments, review such laws, regulations and policies and periodically propose changes or issue
guidance that could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could, for example, limit the types and value of financial services and products we offer, alter our liability or
increase our cost to offer such services and products. It is possible that one or more legislative proposals may be adopted or regulatory changes may be implemented that would have an adverse effect
on our business. 

 We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties  

        In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by or on
behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and
completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to borrowers under certain loan
programs, we assume that the information provided by a customer is accurate and complete and we do not independently verify that information. Our financial condition and results of operations could be
negatively impacted to the extent we rely on customer information that is not complete or accurate. 
41



 

 We are exposed to operational risks  

        Countrywide, like all large corporations, is exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders, misinterpretation
or misapplication of rules, regulations or other requirements, unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty
or disabled computer or telecommunication systems. Given the high volume of transactions at Countrywide, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully
corrected. Our dependence upon automated systems to record and process transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical system flaws, or employee tampering or mistakes or manipulation
of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect. We may be subject to disruptions of our systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (including, for
example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages), which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to loss or liability. We are exposed to the risk that our external
vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligation to us (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are), and to the risk that
our (or our vendors') business continuity and data security systems prove not to be adequate to allow us to resume operations in the event of a disruption to our (or our vendors') operations. We also
face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures prove inadequate or are circumvented, thereby causing delays in detection or errors in information. Although we maintain a system of
controls designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses from operational risks in the future that may be material in amount. 

 Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are
inherently uncertain  

        We
have identified several accounting policies as being ""critical"" to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they involve major aspects of our
business, they require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different
conditions or using different assumptions. These critical accounting policies relate to the computation of our allowance for loan losses; valuation of MSRs and retained interests; accounting for gain
on sale of loans and securities, including the valuation of loans and securities pending sale; valuation of liabilities incurred in sale or securitization of loans; determination of impairment related
to future funding obligation under rapid amortization; and accounting for derivatives and our related interest rate risk management activities. Because of the inherent uncertainty of the estimates
associated with these critical accounting policies, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not make significant subsequent adjustments to the related amounts recorded. For more information,
please refer to the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies
section in this Report. 

 Changes in U.S. GAAP could adversely affect our business  

        Our financial reporting complies with U.S. GAAP, and U.S. GAAP is subject to change over time. If new rules or interpretations of existing rules
require us to change our financial reporting, our reported results of operations and financial condition could be affected substantially, including requirements to restate historical financial
reporting. 
42



 

 Our business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce  

        Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain a highly skilled workforce. Competition for the best people in most activities we engage
in can be intense. If we are unable to attract and retain such people, our business and financial results could be adversely impacted. 

 Other Factors  

        The above description of risk factors is not exhaustive. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or those
anticipated include, but are not limited to: 


Unforeseen
cash or capital requirements
A
reduction in government support of homeownership
The
ability of management to effectively implement the Company's strategies and business plans
The
occurrence of natural disasters or other events or circumstances that could impact our operations or could impact the level of claims in the Insurance Segment. 

        Other
risk factors are described elsewhere herein as well as in other reports and documents that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Other factors that could also cause results to differ
from our expectations may not be described in any such report or document. Each of these factors could by itself, or together with one or more other factors, adversely affect our business, results of
operations and/or financial condition. 
 
 
Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments  
        None. 
 
 
Item 2.    Properties  
        We have 39 office locations that support our administrative activities. These locations are office buildings or space in office buildings and most are located in
Southern California, Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, Tampa, Florida and Chandler, Arizona. Of these locations, we own 22 properties and lease 17 properties, which are generally on
one- to ten-year terms. These locations are primarily used in our Mortgage Banking and Banking Segments, with approximately 11 being used by our Capital Markets and Insurance
Segments. We have two locations in the U.K., one in Costa Rica and four in India that are primarily used by our Global Operations Segment. We also have retail branch offices throughout the United
States, which are generally leased on two- to five-year terms and which are used primarily by our Mortgage Banking Segment. 
 
 
Item 3.    Legal Proceedings  
        We are defendants in various legal proceedings involving matters generally incidental to our businesses. 
        In
addition, various lawsuits alleging claims for derivative relief on behalf of the Company and securities, retirement plan, and other class action suits have recently been brought
against us and certain of our current and former officers, directors and retirement plan administrators in either federal district court in Los Angeles, California, or state superior court in Los
Angeles, or state court in Delaware. Among other things, these lawsuits allege breach of state law fiduciary duties and violation of the federal securities laws and the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA""). These cases allege, among other things, that we did not disclose complete and accurate information about our mortgage lending practices and financial condition. The
shareholder derivative cases brought in federal court are brought on our behalf and do not seek recovery of damages from us. Two 
43



 

consolidated
cases alleging claims for derivative relief on behalf of the Company are also pending in federal district court in Delaware, and allege, among other things, that certain of our proxy
filings contain incorrect statements relating to the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer. 
        Various
class action lawsuits relating to our proposed merger with Bank of America have been filed in the state courts of California and Delaware on behalf of a proposed class of
Countrywide shareholders against the Company, our directors and Bank of America. The class action lawsuits filed in state court in California have been removed to federal court in Los Angeles. These
lawsuits allege that the Company's directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders by entering into the merger agreement with Bank of America and that Bank of America allegedly
aided and abetted those alleged breaches. Similarly, the plaintiffs in the shareholder derivative lawsuits brought in California state and federal court recently have amended their complaints to add
similar class action allegations relating to the proposed merger with Bank of America. 
        Although
we believe we have meritorious defenses to each of these actions and intend to defend them vigorously, it is difficult to predict the resulting outcome of these proceedings,
particularly where investigations and proceedings are in early stages. Given the inherent difficulty in predicting the outcome of our legal proceedings, we cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses
for legal proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, such as those discussed in the two immediately preceding paragraphs. We provide for potential losses
that may arise out of legal proceedings to the extent such losses are deemed probable and can be estimated. Although the ultimate outcome of the legal proceedings discussed above cannot be ascertained
at this time, we believe that any resulting liability will not materially affect our consolidated financial position; such resolution, however, could be material to our operating results for a
particular future period depending upon the outcome of the proceedings and the operating results for a particular period. Our assessment is based, in part, on the existence of insurance coverage. 
 
 
Item 4.    Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders  
        None.

PART II     
 
 
Item 5.    Market for the Company's Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchase of Equity Securities  
        The Company's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (Symbol: CFC). Until January 27, 2007, the Company's common stock was also listed on
NYSE Arca, Inc., formerly the Pacific Stock Exchange. The Company decided to voluntarily delist its common stock from NYSE Arca, Inc. to eliminate duplicative requirements inherent in
dual listings as a result of the NYSE Group's recent merger with the parent company of NYSE Arca, Inc. The following table sets forth the high and low sales prices (as reported by the New York
Stock Exchange) for the Company's common stock and the amount of cash dividends declared during the last two periods:

        The
Company has declared and paid cash dividends on its common stock quarterly since 1982. The Board of Directors of the Company declares dividends based on its review of the most recent
quarter's profitability along with the Company's earnings prospects and capital requirements. During each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company declared quarterly cash
dividends on its common stock totaling $0.60 per share. 
        The
ability of the Company to pay dividends in the future is limited by the earnings, cash position, retained earnings and capital needs of the Company, projected growth rates,
liquidity, general business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by the Company's Board of Directors. The Company is prohibited under certain of its debt agreements, including its guarantee of
CHL's revolving credit facilities, from paying dividends on any capital stock (other than dividends payable in capital stock or stock rights) if in default. The Company also may not
declare or pay dividends or other distributions (other than in common stock or other junior stock) with respect to any common stock, or repurchase or redeem any common stock, unless all accumulated
and unpaid dividends have been paid on its 7.25% non-voting convertible preferred stock. 
        The
primary source of funds for payments to stockholders by the Company is dividends received from its subsidiaries. Accordingly, such payments by the Company in the future also depend
on various restrictive covenants in the debt obligations of its subsidiaries, the earnings, the cash position and the capital needs of its subsidiaries, as well as laws and regulations applicable to
its subsidiaries. Unless the Company maintains a specified minimum level of net worth and certain other financial ratios, it cannot pay dividends and remain in compliance with certain of
CHL's debt obligations (including its revolving 
45



 

credit
facilities). See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital
Resources. The ability of Countrywide Bank to pay dividends is limited by banking regulations. As of February 26, 2008 there were 1,852 shareholders of record of the
Company's common stock, with 580,784,609 common shares outstanding. 
        The
following table shows repurchases by the Company of its common stock for each calendar month during the quarter ended December 31, 2007.

        The
results for 2007 were largely affected by significant disruptions in the U.S. mortgage market and the global capital debt markets, both of which we have historically relied upon to
finance our mortgage production. The combination of a weakening housing market and concern over certain industry-wide product offerings negatively impacted the expectations of future
performance and the value investors assign to mortgage loans and securities. Because of this, investor demand for non-agency mortgage backed securities abruptly declined in the third
quarter of 2007 and participants in the commercial paper and repurchase segments of the debt markets substantially curtailed their financing of our mortgage loan inventories. 
        Mortgage
lenders, including Countrywide, responded by adjusting their loan program and underwriting standards, which had the effect of reducing the availability of mortgage credit to
borrowers. These developments further weakened the housing market and affected mortgage loan performance, resulting in increased losses in our portfolio of loans held for investment and retained
interests created in our loan sales activities. Because of these developments, we recognized significant inventory valuation adjustments, credit related costs and retained interest impairment in 2007. 
        We
discuss our results of operations in detail in the following section, Results of Operations ComparisonYear Ended December 31, 2007 (""2007"")
and Year Ended December 31, 2006 (""2006"").

 Credit  

        Historically, our primary source of credit risk has been the continuing investment and/or obligations we retain, including credit-enhancing subordinated
interests, corporate guarantees, and representations and warranties issued when we sell or securitize loans. Estimated credit losses are considered in the valuation of our subordinated interests;
however, the entire carrying value of such interests is generally at risk, although cash flow accruing to these interests is available to absorb credit losses in the loan pools underlying such
subordinated interests. 
        As
our portfolio of investment loans has grown, our portfolio credit risk has also grown. During 2007, our portfolio of loans held for investment was affected by the deteriorating real
estate market and economic conditions that have not abated as of the date of filing of this Report. As a result of the conditions that prevailed during 2007, the performance of our credit-sensitive
assets was adversely affected. We expect credit quality to continue to deteriorate in the near term, which will continue to cause us to record significant provisions for credit losses and
charge-offs relating to these assets. 
        Following
is a summary of key credit quality and performance indicators at and for the period ended December 31:

        We
discuss credit developments in detail in the section Credit Risk Management, following. 

 Liquidity and Capital  

        During the second half of 2007, our access to capital was severely challenged when the non-agency segments of the secondary mortgage market and the
commercial paper and repurchase agreements segments of the public corporate debt markets were severely restricted by illiquidity, particularly for mortgage companies and other financial institutions.
These conditions have not abated through the date of this Report. 
        In
response to the disruption in the second half of 2007, we accelerated the integration of our mortgage banking activities into our bank subsidiary which has access to stable,
non-capital markets based funding; significantly changed our underwriting standards to focus the majority of our loan production on loans that are available for direct sale to or
securitization into programs sponsored by the government-sponsored agencies; issued $2.0 billion of 7.25% convertible cumulative preferred stock; and modified our funding structure to that of a
thrift holding company. Because of the adjustments we made to our operations, as of December 31, 2007: 


We
maintained excess borrowing capacity totaling $36.6 billion from sources we judge to be reliable;
We
maintained investment-grade ratings from all three of the major credit rating agencies. On January 11, 2008, following the announcement of our pending acquisition
by Bank of America, all three rating agencies placed our ratings on some form of positive watch to reflect the likely upgrade to our ratings following completion of the Merger; and
Our
thrift subsidiary, Countrywide Bank, FSB exceeded the regulatory capital requirements to be classified as ""well capitalized,"" with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.2%;
a Tier 1 Risk-Based capital ratio of 11.8%; and a Total Risk-Based ratio of 14.4%. 


        We
discuss liquidity developments in detail in the section Liquidity Management, following.

 Merger with Bank of America Corporation  

        As more fully detailed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 17, 2008, and the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 of Bank of America filed on February 12, 2008, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Bank of America. The Merger Agreement provides for
Countrywide to merge with and into a wholly-owned merger subsidiary of Bank of America (""Merger Sub""), with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company. 
        The
terms of the Merger Agreement provide for the conversion of each share of Countrywide common stock into 0.1822 of a share of Bank of America common stock. Consummation of the Merger,
which is currently anticipated to occur in the third quarter of 2008, is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, Countrywide stockholder and regulatory approvals. 
        The
Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for Countrywide and Bank of America, as the case may be, applicable upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Merger
Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that, in the event of the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Countrywide may be required to pay Bank of America a termination
fee equal to $160 million. 
        The
Merger Agreement provides for both Countrywide and Bank of America to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course until the Merger is completed and not to take certain
actions during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the date of completion of the Merger. 
 
 
Critical Accounting Policies     
        The accounting policies with the greatest impact on our financial condition and results of operations that require the most judgment, and which are most likely to
result in materially different amounts being recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions, pertain to our mortgage loan sale and securitization activities; our investments in
MSRs and retained interests; our measurement of provisions and reserves associated with the credit risk inherent in our operations and our use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Our critical
accounting policies involve the following five areas: 1) accounting for gain on sale of loans and securities including the valuation of loans held for sale; 2) valuation of MSRs and
retained interests; 3) valuation of liabilities incurred in sale of loans; 4) determination of impairment related to future funding obligation under rapid amortization;
5) computation of allowance for loan losses and 6) accounting for derivatives and interest rate risk management activities. 

 Gain on Sale of Loans and Securities  

        When we sell loans in the secondary mortgage market, we generally do not sell the MSRs that are created. Depending on the type of securitization, we may also
retain other financial interests, including but not limited to, interest-only securities, principal-only securities and residual securities. 
        We
determine the gain on sale of a security or loans by allocating the carrying value of the underlying mortgage loans between securities or loans sold and the interests we continue to
hold, based on their relative fair values. The gain on sale we report is the difference between the proceeds we receive from the sale and the cost allocated to the securities or loans sold. The
proceeds include cash and other assets obtained (primarily MSRs) less any liabilities incurred (i.e., liabilities for representations and warranties or other recourse provisions). The timing of
gain recognition is dependent on the terms of the transaction meeting very specific accounting criteria and, as a result, the gain on sale may be recorded in a different form or in a different
accounting period from when the transfer of the loans is completed. In addition, the amount of gain on sale recorded is influenced by the values of the MSRs and retained interests at the time of sale.

 Valuation of Loans Held for Sale  

        As a result of the market disruption in the latter part of 2007, the precise market value of our non-conforming prime, Prime Home Equity and Nonprime
Loans was not readily determinable. These loans represent approximately 44% of mortgage loans originated or purchased for resale excluding loans secured by commercial real estate at
December 31, 2007. In addition, we transferred approximately $21.8 billion of mortgage loans from held for sale to held for investment in 2007. The loans transferred were primarily
non-conforming prime, Prime Home Equity and Nonprime Loans and were transferred at the lower of cost or fair value, resulting in a write-down of such loans in the amount of
$1.1 billion. 
        The
Company generally estimates the fair value of mortgage loans based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. If quoted market prices are not available,
fair value is estimated based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations, prices available for similar instruments, and valuation models intended to approximate the amounts that
would be received from a third party. We regularly compare the values developed from our valuation models to executed trades to assure that the valuations are reflective of actual sale prices.
However, due to the illiquidity of the mortgage marketplace prevalent at December 31, 2007, which resulted in a lack of executed trades that could be used to assure that the valuations are
reflective of fair value, it was necessary to look for 
53



 

alternative
sources of value, including the whole loan purchase market for similar loans, and to apply more judgment to the valuations of non-conforming prime, home equity and nonprime
loans. 
        Based
on our analysis of available market data for non agency-eligible loans during the fourth quarter of 2007, we determined that the whole loan purchase market was the most appropriate
market for products traded in that market, including Prime Home Equity and prime non-conforming fixed-rate and hybrid ARM loans. For the portion of such loans that did not meet
the specific loan level requirements of this market, we estimated the value of these loans using a valuation model. The key assumptions used in the valuation model are prepayment speeds, loss
estimates and the discount rate. We develop prepayment and credit loss assumptions based on the historical performance of the loans in our servicing portfolio adjusted for the current economic
environment as appropriate. The discount rate used in these valuations was derived from the whole loan purchase market, adjusted for our estimate of the required yield for these loans. We believe that
such assumptions are consistent with assumptions that other major market participants use in determining such assets' fair values. 
        The
remainder of our prime non-conforming loans, most significantly pay-option ARMs, and our Nonprime Loans was valued using required subordination levels
combined with required yields available for securities backed by similar product type and credit grades where observable trades existed. We use a third party vendor model to determine the required
subordination levels. We estimate required yields by reference to actual trades where available combined with adjustments to the observable yields based on historical spreads, adjusted for the
illiquidity in the current environment. We believe that such assumptions are consistent with assumptions that other major market participants use in determining such loans' fair values. 

 Valuation of MSRs and Retained Interests  

        The precise market value of MSRs and retained interests cannot be readily determined because these assets are not actively traded in stand-alone markets.
Considerable judgment is required to determine the fair values of our MSRs and retained interests, and the exercise of such judgment can significantly impact the Company's earnings. Small changes in
the assumptions used to estimate the value of MSRs and retained interests can have a significant effect on our estimates of value. Similarly, relatively small changes in value of these assets can have
a material effect on earnings for a particular period. As a result, senior financial management exercises extensive and active oversight of this process. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee, which
is comprised of several of our senior financial executives, ultimately approves the valuation of MSRs and retained interests. 
        Our
MSR valuation process combines the use of a discounted cash flow model and extensive analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value at each balance sheet
date. The cash flow assumptions and prepayment assumptions used in our discounted cash flow model are based on market factors and encompass the historical performance of our MSRs. We perform research
and analysis to assure that the assumptions we use are consistent with assumptions and data used by market participants valuing similar MSRs. The key assumptions used in the valuation of MSRs include
mortgage prepayment speeds and the discount rate (projected London Inter Bank Offering Rate (""LIBOR"") plus option-adjusted spread). These variables can, and generally do, change from quarter to
quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. The current market data utilized in the MSR valuation process and in the assessment of the reasonableness of our valuation is obtained
from peer group MSR valuation surveys, MSR market trades, MSR broker valuations and prices of interest-only securities.

following table shows the key assumptions we used to determine the fair values of our MSRs at December 31, 2007 and the value sensitivity of our MSRs to changes in such
assumptions.

spread over LIBOR. 

        The
yield implied in the market value of the MSRs was 10.9% at December 31, 2007. 
        For
our retained interests, we also estimate fair value through the use of discounted cash flow models. The key assumptions used in the valuation of our retained interests include
mortgage prepayment speeds, discount rates, and for retained interests containing credit risk, the net lifetime credit losses. For further discussion of credit risk, see section in this Report
entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCredit Risk Retained in Loan Sales. We
develop cash flow, prepayment and net lifetime credit loss assumptions based on the historical performance of the loans underlying our retained interests adjusted for the current economic environment
as appropriate. We believe that such assumptions are consistent with assumptions that other major market participants use in determining such assets' fair values. The process for estimating lifetime
credit losses used in the valuation of residual interests or the valuation of liabilities incurred is similar. See the section following entitled Valuation of Liabilities
Incurred in Sale of Loans for additional discussion of estimated lifetime credit losses.

        These
sensitivities shown for MSRs and retained interests are solely for illustrative purposes and should be used with caution. This information is furnished to provide
the reader with a basis for assessing the sensitivity of the values presented to changes in key assumptions. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on a given percentage variation in
individual assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated. In addition, in the above tables, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs or retained interests is
calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may coincide with changes in another, which could compound or counteract the sensitivities. 

 Valuation of Liabilities Incurred in Sale of Loans  

        We incur liabilities in our loan sales and securitizations through representations and warranties we make or through other recourse provisions, such as corporate
guarantees. An active market to transfer the liabilities relating to representations and warranties and corporate guarantees does not exist. Therefore, management must estimate the fair value of such
liabilities. When credit risk is retained through liabilities incurred in the sale or securitization of loans, the lifetime credit losses are estimated as follows and are discounted at a
risk-free rate of return. 


Lifetime
credit losses are developed by estimating when and how many loans will default and multiplying that amount by how much of the loan will be uncollectible (""loss
severity"").
Default
rates are estimated using default curves used for pricing securities backed by the type of loans for which the obligation is being retained.
Loss
severities are estimated using multi-attribute severity models similar in nature to those used to calculate probability of default. 

        Our
process for estimating lifetime credit losses benefits from the extensive history and experience we have developed from our mortgage loan servicing portfolio. This estimation process
is also subject to the uncertainty that reliance on historical factors giving rise to losses and offsetting recoveries does not accurately reflect current conditions or predict future events. We
address this risk by considering current economic and market conditions. Based on our assessments of current conditions, we make appropriate adjustments to our historically developed assumptions when
necessary to adjust historical 
56



 

factors
to account for present conditions. The effect of changes in certain key assumptions on our estimated liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is as follows:

        Credit
risk is an integral consideration in the valuation of retained interests. The impact of changes in credit loss assumptions on the value of retained interests is included in the
section, Valuation of MSRs and Retained Interests. 

 Impairment Related to Future Funding Obligation under Rapid Amortization  

        Under the terms of the Company's home equity line of credit securitizations, Countrywide makes advances to borrowers when they request a subsequent draw on their
line of credit and Countrywide is reimbursed for those advances from the cash flows in the securitization. This reimbursement normally occurs within a short period after the advance. However, in the
event that loan losses requiring draws on monoline insurer's policies (which protect the bondholders in the securitization) exceed a specified threshold or duration, reimbursement of Countrywide's
advances for subsequent draws occurs only after other parties in the securitization (including the senior bondholders and the monoline insurer) have received all of the cash flows to which they are
entitled. This status, known as rapid amortization, has the effect of extending the time period for which the Company's advances are outstanding, and may result in Countrywide not receiving
reimbursement for all of the funds advanced. During 2007, Countrywide recorded impairment losses of $704.1 million related to estimated future draw obligations on the securitization deals that
have entered or are expected to enter rapid amortization status. 
        We
estimate the impairment losses related to future draw obligations through the use of discounted cash flow models. This estimate requires projections of future expected funding
obligations under a rapid amortization event compared to the expected fair value of the amount to be recovered as of the required funding date. The resulting amount is then discounted to a present
value amount based on an appropriate risk-free interest rate to arrive at the amount of our funding obligation. The key assumptions used in our estimation process include mortgage prepayment speeds,
additional draws on home equity lines of credit, discount rates, and net lifetime credit losses. As discussed in the preceding section entitled Valuation of MSRs and Retained
Interests, we develop cash flow, prepayment and net lifetime credit loss assumptions based on the historical performance of the loans underlying our retained interests adjusted
for the current economic environment, as appropriate, and our assumptions of additional draws on home equity lines of credit are developed in a similar manner. The process for estimating lifetime
credit losses used in the valuation of residual interests, the valuation of liabilities incurred and our estimated impairment losses related to future draw obligations is similar. See the preceding
section entitled Valuation of Liabilities Incurred in Sale of Loans for additional discussion of estimated lifetime credit losses. 
57




 





 Allowance for Loan Losses  

        The allowance for loan losses is our best estimate of the credit losses incurred in our loan investment portfolio. 
        We
continually assess the credit quality of our portfolios of loans held for investment to identify and provide for losses incurred. Once a loan is included in our investment portfolio,
how we assess loan credit quality is based on whether the loan is part of a pool of homogeneous loans or is individually evaluated for impairment. 

 Homogeneous Loan Pools  

        Our mortgage loan portfolios are comprised primarily of large groups of homogeneous loans secured by residential real estate and made to consumers. We do not
evaluate individual homogenous loans for impairment. We estimate the losses incurred in our homogeneous loan pools by estimating how many of the loans will default and how much of the loans' balances
will be lost in the event of default. 
        We
estimate how many of our homogeneous loans will default based on the loans' attributes (occupancy status, loan-to-value ratio, borrower credit score, etc.)
which is further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). This estimate is based on our historical experience with our loan
servicing portfolio. Our estimate is adjusted to reflect our assessment of environmental factors not yet reflected in the historical data underlying our loss estimates, such as trends in real estate
values, local and national economic trends, changes in underwriting standards and changes in the regulatory environment. 
        The
likelihood of default is based on analysis of movement of loans with the measured attributes from either current or each of the delinquency categories to default over a twelve-month
period. Loans 90 or more days past due or those expected to migrate to 90 or more days past due within the twelve-month
period are assigned a rate of default that measures the percentage of such loans that will default over their lives as we assume that the condition causing the ultimate default presently exists. We
estimate how much of the defaulted loans' balances will be lost based on our estimate of the average loss severity for defaulted loans by type (Prime Mortgage, Nonprime Mortgage or Prime Home Equity
Loans). 
        Loan
losses are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when management believes the loss is confirmed. We make an initial assessment of whether a charge-off is
required on our mortgage loans no later than the 180th day of delinquency. 

 Individually Evaluated Loans  

        On a regular basis, we individually evaluate loans in our warehouse and commercial lending portfolios for impairment based on borrower-provided financial
information and our assessments of collateral. We have an internally-developed loan rating system for our warehouse lending and other commercial loans that is used to determine when an allowance is
required for a loan. We charge off losses in individually evaluated loans when the loss is confirmed. The charge-off is based on our estimate of value of the collateral securing the loan.
We develop an allowance for losses on warehouse lending loans for which specific losses have not been identified. This allowance is developed by applying credit loss factors applicable to the
individual loan's assigned ratings. 
        We
also individually evaluate mortgage loans in our portfolio of loans held for investment when we agree to modification of the loans' contractual terms that we make because we, for
economic or other reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties, grant a concession to the borrower that we would not otherwise consider. We classify these loans as troubled debt
restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings may include changing repayment terms, reducing the stated interest rate, reducing the 
58



 

loan's
principal balance or accrued interest, or extending the maturity date of the loan. Upon completion of a troubled debt restructuring, we establish a valuation allowance to recognize the
impairment of the loan. 
        The
amount of the impairment valuation allowance is established based on whether the loan is collateral dependent and delinquent when the loan is modified: 


Impairment
valuation allowances relating to loans that are collateral dependent and delinquent when they are modified are established with reference to the difference
between the loan's
carrying value and the estimated fair value of the collateral securing the loan reduced by the cost to sell the collateral;
Impairment
valuation allowances relating to loans that are not collateral dependent or are collateral dependent but not delinquent when they are modified are established
with reference to the difference between the loan's carrying value and the present value of the estimated cash flows of the loan under its modified terms discounted at the loan's effective interest
rate. 

        Loan
losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the loss is confirmed. We make an initial assessment of whether a charge-off is required on our
mortgage loans no later than the 180th day of delinquency. 

 Sensitivity of Estimates  

        Our allowance estimation process benefits from the extensive history and experience we have developed in our mortgage loan servicing activities. However, this
process is subject to risks and uncertainties, including reliance on historical loss information that may not represent current conditions and the proper identification of factors giving rise to
credit losses. For example, new products may have default rates and loss severities which differ from those products we have historically offered and upon which our estimates are based. We address
this risk by actively monitoring the delinquency and default experience of our homogenous pools by considering current economic and market conditions. Based on our assessments of current conditions,
we make appropriate adjustments to our historically developed assumptions when necessary to adjust historical factors to account for present conditions. Our senior management is actively involved in
the review and approval of our allowance for loan losses.

calculated independently without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another which might compound or counteract the sensitivities. 

 Derivatives and Interest Rate Risk Management Activities  

        We use derivatives extensively in connection with our interest rate risk management activities. We record all derivative instruments at fair value. 
        We
may qualify some of our interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting. A primary requirement to qualify for hedge accounting is the documented expectation and
demonstration, both initially and on an ongoing basis, that our interest rate risk management activity is highly effective. We use standard statistical measures to determine the effectiveness of our
hedging activity. If we are unable to, or choose not to, qualify certain interest rate risk management activities for hedge accounting, then a possible earnings mismatch may be created because, unlike
the derivative instruments, the change in fair value of the related asset or liability may not be reflected in current-period earnings. This issue is potentially most significant with our inventory of
loans held for sale, which is required to be carried at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value and our debt instruments and other liabilities that are carried at historical cost. With the
market disruption in late 2007, we were not able to qualify a significant portion of our non-conforming Prime Mortgage Loan inventory for hedge accounting. 
        In
connection with our mortgage loan origination activities, we issue commitments to make or purchase loans (also referred to as interest rate lock commitments or ""IRLCs""). An IRLC
guarantees a loan's terms, subject to credit approval, for a period typically between seven and 75 days. The majority of our IRLCs qualify as derivative instruments and, therefore, are required
to be recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in current-period earnings. However, there is no active market for 
60



 

IRLCs
that can be used to determine their fair value and as a result we utilize an alternative method for estimating the fair value of our IRLCs. 
        We
estimate the fair value of an IRLC based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan, adjusted for the probability that the loan will fund within the terms
of the IRLC. The change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the date we issue the commitment. Therefore, at the time of issuance the estimated fair value of an IRLC is zero.
After issuance, the value of an IRLC can be either positive or negative, depending on the change in value of the underlying mortgage loan. The Company generally estimates the fair value of the
underlying loan based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on other relevant factors,
including dealer price quotations, prices available for similar instruments, and valuation models intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from a third party. We regularly compare
the values developed from our valuation models to executed trades to assure that the valuations are reflective of actual sale prices. However, due to the illiquidity of the mortgage marketplace
prevalent at December 31, 2007 and a lack of executed trades that could be used to assure that the valuations are reflective of fair value, it was necessary to look for alternative sources of
value, including the whole loan purchase market for similar
loans, and to apply more judgment to the valuations of non-conforming prime, home equity and nonprime loans. 
        The
primary factor influencing the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC is the change, if any, in mortgage rates subsequent to the commitment date. In
general, the probability of funding increases if mortgage rates rise and decreases if mortgage rates fall. This is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to
the applicant's committed rate. The probability that a loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC also is influenced by the source of the application, age of the application, purpose for the loan
(purchase or refinance) and the application approval rate. We have developed closing ratio estimates using empirical data that take into account all of these variables, as well as renegotiations of
rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall. These closing ratio estimates are used to calculate the aggregate balance of loans that we expect to fund within the terms of
the IRLCs. 
 
 
Results of Operations ComparisonYear Ended December 31, 2007 (""2007"") and Year Ended December 31, 2006 (""2006"")     

 Consolidated Results of Operations  

        We recorded a net loss for 2007 of $703.5 million, as compared to net earnings of $2,674.8 million in 2006. Our diluted loss per share was $2.03
compared to diluted earnings per share of $4.30 from the year-ago period. 
        The
results for 2007 were largely affected by marketplace concerns about the credit performance of securitized mortgage loans and the worsening credit performance of our portfolio of
loans held for investment: 


Marketplace
concerns about mortgage loan performance contributed to widening credit spreads and illiquidity in the secondary mortgage market and debt markets, which
negatively affected the salability and value of our mortgage loan pipeline and inventory of loans and securities. During 2007, we recognized $1.5 billion of impairment of these assets,
primarily related to transfers of certain loans held for sale to our investment portfolio due to the market disruption
The
values of our credit-sensitive retained interests were negatively affected by increased loss expectations on the loans that underlie these assets, combined with
increased investor yield requirements, resulting in an increase in impairment of $2.2 billion 

61



 




Our
provision for loan losses increased by $2,052.3 million to $2,286.2 million, reflecting worsening loan portfolio performance, including increased rates of
delinquencies and default and loss severity on defaulted loans
We
expect the mortgage market to continue its decline in volume through 2008 and began the process of adjusting the scale of our operations in response to this decline. In
2007, we recognized $144.6 million in restructuring expenses relating to this effort and we expect to record another $15 million to $25 million in restructuring expenses in the
first quarter of 2008. 

        The
Mortgage Banking Segment generated a pre-tax loss of $1,517.1 million, a worsening of results of operations of $3,579.5 million from 2006. This decrease was
largely due to a 55% decline in gain on sale of loans and securities within the Production Sector from $4,897.8 million in 2006 to $2,220.2 million in 2007. This decline began early in
2007 with nonprime loans and expanded during the year to include all non-agency products. The impairment of our mortgage loan pipeline and inventory amounting to $1,458.6 million is
included in gain on sale of loans and securities. In the Loan Servicing sector, we have recorded impairment of credit-sensitive residuals in the amount of $2,303.8 million and a provision for
loan losses of $448.6 million. 
        The
Banking Segment produced a pre-tax loss of $268.8 million, a $1,649.1 million decline from 2006, largely due to increased credit-related costs on the
portfolio of loans held for investment. 
        The
Capital Markets Segment was negatively affected by declining liquidity and prices in the mortgage-related securities market. As a result of these conditions, the Capital Markets
Segment recorded losses on sales of securities and inventory and reported pre-tax earnings of $15.0 million during 2007, a decline of $538.5 million from 2006. 
        These
decreases were partially offset by an increase in the profitability of the Insurance Segment, due to an increase in the net earned premiums and a reversal of loss reserves related
to the 2003 book of reinsurance business on which negligible remaining loss exposure was deemed to exist in 2007.

        Our
total loan production was $415.6 billion for 2007, as compared to $468.2 billion in 2006. Loan production decreased due to an approximately 20% decline in the mortgage
market from 2006, which occurred largely in the latter part of 2007 as a result of a tightening of underwriting and loan program guidelines done in response to increased marketplace concerns about
mortgage loan performance, as well as economic conditions which include a weakening housing market. The tightening of underwriting and loan program guidelines included reductions in the availability
of reduced documentation loans and loans on investor-owned properties and a reduction in the maximum loan-to-value or combined loan-to-value ratios. The
impact of these changes was most significant to Nonprime Mortgage, Prime Home Equity and non-conforming Prime Mortgage Loans. We discontinued production of Nonprime Mortgage Loans in late
2007. The decrease in loan production volume was partially offset by an increase in our market share from 14.1% to 15.5% (based on our internal market estimates). The increase in our market share was
primarily driven by increased market share in our Correspondent Lending Channel.

Mortgage Banking Segment  
        The Mortgage Banking Segment includes the Loan Production, Loan Servicing and Loan Closing Services Sectors. 

 Loan Production Sector  

        The Loan Production Sector sources mortgage loans through the three production channels of our mortgage banking subsidiary, Countrywide Home Loansthe
Retail Channel (Consumer Markets and Full Spectrum Lending), Wholesale Lending Channel and Correspondent Lending Channel. These loans are funded through any one of these channels or through
Countrywide Bank, FSB (""Countrywide Bank"" or the ""Bank""). As a result of the market disruption in the current year, we decided to accelerate our plans to migrate virtually all of our loan production
into the Bank which has greater access to sources of liquidity. During 2007, 55% of the loans funded in the Mortgage Banking Segment were funded through the Bank compared to 25% for the prior year. In
the quarter ended December 31, 2007, 91% of the Mortgage Banking loan production was funded through the Bank. Effective January 1, 2008, our production channels have moved into the Bank,
completing the migration of substantially all of our loan production activities from CHL to the Bank. The mortgage loan production, the related balance sheet and the income relating to the holding and
sale of these loans is included in our Mortgage Banking Segment regardless of whether the activity occurred in CHL or Countrywide Bank.

        The
Loan Production sector incurred a pre-tax loss of $1,185.1 million during 2007 compared to pre-tax earnings of $1,310.9 million in 2006. The
current year loss resulted primarily from the disruption in the secondary market beginning in the third quarter of 2007 for non-agency loans, including prime non-conforming,
Prime Home Equity and Nonprime Mortgage Loans. The illiquidity and credit spread widening caused by the market disruption had a significant negative impact on the value of such loans and the amount of
loans that were sold. As a result, we recorded inventory valuation and pipeline write-downs on such loans during 2007 of $1,354.4 million, net of a credit hedge in place for part of the period.
In addition, the volume of nonprime loans and home equity loans sold declined to $23.5 billion in 2007 compared to $65.1 billion in 2006, contributing to the decline in revenues. 
        Expenses
decreased from the prior year driven primarily by a reduction in variable compensation expenses that resulted from the decline in the volume of loans produced, and remained flat
as a percentage of loans produced. The decline in the volume of loans produced reflects a smaller origination market in the latter part of the year, which was largely attributable to the tightening of
underwriting and loan program guidelines as well as economic conditions including a weakening housing market. Significant adjustments have been made to our infrastructure and staffing levels as
appropriate for a smaller origination market and further adjustments will be made in the future as appropriate. The majority of the expense reductions were made in the latter part of the year so we do
not expect to see the full benefit of these reductions until 2008.

 Loan Servicing Sector  

        The results of our Loan Servicing Sector include fees and other income earned and expenses incurred for servicing loans for others; the financial performance of
our investments in MSRs and retained interests and the risk management activities related to these assets; and profits from our subservicing activities. The long-term performance of this
sector is affected primarily by the level and direction of interest rates, the level of projected and actual prepayments in our servicing portfolio, projected and actual credit losses, our operational
effectiveness and our ability to manage interest-rate and credit-spread risk. 
        Our
servicing portfolio grew to $1.5 trillion at December 31, 2007, a 14% increase from the prior year. At the same time, the overall weighted-average note rate of loans in our
servicing portfolio increased to 6.6% from 6.5% at December 31, 2006.

(1)The
Servicing Hedge loss was not allocated between MSRs and credit-sensitive retained interests during 2006. 
        Loan
Servicing Sector pre-tax earnings before credit-sensitive retained interests were $1,834.8 million during 2007 compared to $754.8 million in 2006. The
increase is due to higher operating earnings as result of a larger servicing portfolio and improvement in valuation changes of the MSRs and non credit-sensitive retained interests, net of the
Servicing Hedge. These positive factors were partially offset by an increase in interest expense resulting from a larger investment in servicing

assets
and an increase in the provision for loan losses related to Mortgage Banking loans held for investment. The MSR valuation was positively impacted by slower current and expected prepayment
speeds resulting from the market disruption in the latter part of 2007, which partially mitigated the interest-rate driven decrease in MSRs. 
        Loan
Servicing sector results were negatively impacted by impairment losses of $2,303.8 million on credit-sensitive retained interests, largely related to subordinated interests
backed by Prime Home Equity Loans and to a lesser extent Nonprime Mortgage Loans. These charges resulted from increases in actual current and estimated future credit losses on the underlying loans
driven by worsening delinquency trends and housing market conditions. In addition, the discount rates were increased reflecting higher market yield requirements on these investments. 
        Under
the terms of the Company's home equity line of credit securitizations, Countrywide makes advances to borrowers when they request a subsequent draw on their line of credit and
Countrywide is reimbursed for those advances from the cash flows in the securitization. This reimbursement normally occurs within a short period after the advance. However, in the event that loan
losses requiring draws on monoline insurer's policies (which protect the bondholders in the securitization) exceed a specified threshold or duration, reimbursement of Countrywide advances for
subsequent draws occurs only after other parties in the securitization (including the senior bondholders and the monoline insurer) have received all of the cash flows to which they are entitled. This
status, known as rapid amortization, has the effect of extending the time period for which the Company's advances are outstanding, and may result in Countrywide not receiving reimbursement for all of
the funds advanced. During 2007, Countrywide recorded impairment losses of $704.1 million related to estimated future draw obligations on the securitization deals that have entered or are
expected to enter rapid amortization status. This amount is included in impairment losses related to credit-sensitive retained interests. 
        The
aggregate carrying value of the Company's investments in credit-sensitive residuals at December 31, 2007 was $736.3 million compared to $2.1 billion at
December 31, 2006. The carrying value of the credit-sensitive residuals related to securitizations that have entered or are expected to enter rapid amortization status is zero at
December 31, 2007. The liability for losses applicable to future draw advances at December 31, 2007 was $704.1 million. 

 Loan Closing Services Sector  

        This sector is comprised of the LandSafe companies, which provide credit reports, flood determinations, appraisals and title reports primarily to the Loan
Production Sector and to third parties as well. 
        The
LandSafe companies produced $109.1 million in pre-tax earnings during 2007, representing an increase of 19% from 2006. The increase in LandSafe's
pre-tax earnings was primarily due to an increase in appraisal business from CHL and an increase in its title and default business due to increased foreclosure activity.

 Banking Segment  
        The Banking Segment includes Banking Operationsprimarily the investment and fee-based activities of Countrywide Bankalong
with the activities of Countrywide Warehouse Lending (""CWL""). Banking Operations invests in mortgage loans sourced from the Loan Production Sector, as well as loans and mortgage-backed
securities purchased from nonaffiliates. CWL provides other mortgage lenders with temporary financing secured by mortgage loans. Following is a summary of Banking Operations' loan acquisitions by

        As
a result of the market disruption, a significant portion of nonconforming Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (""ARM"") and Prime Home Equity Loans held for sale were written down in
our Mortgage Banking Segment and then transferred to the Banking Segment during 2007. These loans were transferred at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. 
        The
Banking Segment incurred a pre-tax loss of $268.8 million during 2007, compared to pre-tax earnings of $1,380.4 million for the prior year.

(1)Includes
provision for loan losses plus provision for losses on unfunded loan commitments.
(2)Non-interest
expense, including mortgage insurance expense, divided by the sum of net interest income plus non-interest income. The Banking Operations'
efficiency ratio reflects the expense structure resulting from its relationship with Countrywide Home Loans but does not include allocated corporate expenses. Banking Operation's expense structure was
reflective of the Bank's relationship with Countrywide Home Loans. If Banking Operations were a stand-alone entity, the nature and amount of its expenses would differ from those reported. For example,
prior to October 2007, the fulfillment fees paid by Countrywide Bank to the Loan Production Sector for origination costs incurred on investment mortgage loans funded by Countrywide Bank were generally
determined on an incremental cost basis which is less than would be incurred in an arms-length transaction. 
        Banking
Operations incurred a pre-tax loss of $219.9 million during 2007, a decrease of $1,604.3 million, from pre-tax earnings of
$1,384.4 million for the year-ago period. This decrease resulted primarily from a higher provision for credit losses and an increase in non-interest expense, partially
offset by an increase in net interest income. The Banking Operations' provision for credit losses increased by $1,691.0 million during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase in the provision for
credit losses was primarily due to higher incurred losses in our loan portfolio driven by the impact of the weakening housing market and significant tightening of available credit on delinquency and
default trends as well as portfolio seasoning. The provision for credit losses and the related allowance for credit losses is affected by many factors, including economic conditions (for example,
housing prices, interest rates and unemployment rates), borrower credit profiles, delinquency, and loan seasoning and prepayments. Non-interest expense increased $216.1 million
reflecting Banking Operations' continuing growth, increased purchases of mortgage insurance for its portfolio of loans held for investment and a $48.8 million increase in deposit insurance
expense.

        The
increase in net interest income was primarily due to a $10.5 billion, or 13%, increase in average interest-earning assets combined with a 10 basis point increase in net
interest margin. The increase in the net interest margin from 2006 was primarily a result of a smaller rate lag impact as the spread between the 12-Month Treasury Average index, which is
the index to which most of the Bank's assets are priced, and LIBOR, which is the index to which most of the Bank's liabilities are priced, tightened. In addition, the reduced impact of introductory
rates earned on recently funded pay-option loans contributed to the increase in net interest margin as fewer such loans were originated in 2007 compared to the prior year. These positive
factors were partially offset by a
shift in asset mix to include a larger portion of lower-yielding high-credit quality mortgage-backed securities.

as the yield on total interest-earning assets less the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. 
        Interest-earning
assets growth came from the acquisition of high-credit quality mortgage-backed securities from non-affiliates and additions of
$36.9 billion to the loans held for investment portfolio, including $18.8 billion of loans transferred from the Mortgage Banking Segment to Banking Operations during 2007. 
        The
Banking Segment also includes the operations of CWL. CWL's pre-tax earnings decreased by $31.5 million during 2007 in comparison to the prior year.
This decline was primarily due to a 56% decrease in average mortgage warehouse advances, which resulted primarily from a decrease in overall market funding activity and to competitive pricing
pressure. Warehouse lending advances were $0.9 billion at December 31, 2007 and had an average yield of 6.4% during 2007.

Capital Markets Segment  
        Our Capital Markets Segment recorded pre-tax earnings of $15.0 million during 2007, a decrease of $538.5 million, or 97%, from 2006. 
        The
market dislocation experienced during the current year caused significant disruption to the activities of our Capital Markets Segment. Specifically, the markets in which our Capital
Markets Segment operates became illiquid and the availability of financing for certain of the segment's activities was severely reduced. As a result, we were required to curtail certain of our
business activities and to sell a significant portion of our trading assets at depressed prices.

        During
2007, the commercial real estate finance activities of the Capital Markets Segment generated revenues totaling $168.9 million compared to $104.0 million in 2006. The
increase in revenue was due primarily to an increase in the volume of loans sold. However, late in the year our commercial real estate lending activities were substantially curtailed because of the
loss of available outside financing and disruptions in the securities market for commercial mortgage-backed securities. 
        Our
underwriting revenues decreased primarily due to losses in our inventory of securities resulting from the effects of the market dislocation on the value of our holdings from previous
underwritings, as well as a 51% reduction in the volume of underwritings during the year. 
        During
2007, conduit revenues decreased compared to 2006 due to a reduction in volume of loans sold combined with decreased margins on such sales and write-downs of inventory, partially
offset by gains of $306.6 million from credit default swaps used to moderate credit spread risk. The decrease in margins was caused primarily by the market disruption in the latter part of
2007.

        Our
mortgage reinsurance business produced an increase in pre-tax earnings of $116.0 million, or 54%, over the prior year, resulting primarily from a
$74.0 million reversal of loss reserves related to the 2003 book of reinsurance business, on which negligible remaining loss exposure was deemed to exist in 2007. Also contributing to the
increase in pre-tax earnings was growth of 35% in the mortgage loans included in our loan servicing portfolio that are covered by reinsurance contracts. 
        On
February 14, 2008, Freddie Mac announced a temporary change to its private mortgage insurer requirements. Effective for loans funded on or after June 1, 2008, Freddie
Mac-approved private mortgage insurers may not cede new risk if the gross risk or gross premium ceded to captive mortgage companies, such as Balboa Reinsurance Company, is greater than
25 percent. Because the companies for which Balboa Reinsurance Company provides reinsured mortgage insurance are all Freddie Mac-approved private mortgage insurers, this temporary policy change
could have a direct impact on all of our reinsurance business. 
        Presently,
private mortgage insurers cede on average 35% of their premiums to us. Therefore, while Freddie Mac's temporary policy change is in effect, Countrywide will not be able to
underwrite the same level of risk or realize the same level of premium revenue on new business as it has in the past. The effect of this temporary change on the profitability of our reinsurance
business has not yet been determined and will depend, in part, on the agreements we negotiate with the private mortgage insurance companies whose risk we reinsure during the coming months. 
        Our
Life and Casualty insurance business produced pre-tax earnings of $301.9 million, an increase of $163.4 million, or 118%, from the prior year. The increase
in earnings was primarily driven by a $287.1 million, or 30%, increase in net earned premiums during 2007 in comparison to 2006, partially offset by an $119.1 million increase in
insurance claim expenses during 2007 as compared to 2006. The increase in net earned premiums was primarily attributable to growth in lender-placed insurance. The increase in insurance claim expenses
was driven by growth in premiums as well as an increase in catastrophe losses. However claim expenses were comparable with 2006 as a percentage of
net premiums earned. During 2007, our Life & Casualty business incurred losses of $18.8 million relating to the California wildfires. 
        Our
Life and Casualty operations seek to earn profits by capitalizing on Countrywide's customer base and institutional relationships, as well as through operating efficiencies and sound
underwriting. Insurance risk is managed through the use of reinsurance. 
Global Operations Segment  
        Global Operation's pre-tax earnings totaled $27.5 million during 2007, a decrease of $1.1 million from 2006. The decrease in earnings
was primarily due to the termination of the joint venture with Barclays Bank, PLC in 2006, partially offset by an increase in revenue recognized from the licensing of software to a third party
and offshore services provided for other segments of the Company.

(1)Includes
loans sourced from the Mortgage Banking Segment.
(2)Gain
on sale as a percentage of loans sold. 
        The
disruption in the secondary markets during the second half of 2007 for Nonprime Mortgage, Prime Home Equity, and non-conforming prime loans and securities caused a
reduction in gain on sale during 2007 in both our Mortgage Banking and Capital Market Segments. The illiquidity and credit spread widening caused by the market disruption negatively impacted the value
of such loans and securities and the volume of such loans and securities that were sold. 

 Mortgage Banking Segment 

        Gain on sale of Prime Mortgage Loans decreased during 2007 as compared to 2006, due primarily to lower margins partially offset by higher sales volume. The
decline in margins was due to increased price competition, change in product mix to lower-margin products and a shift in channel mix towards our Correspondent Lending Channel, which has lower margins
than our origination channels. Also contributing to the decline in prime gain on sale were write-downs of the mortgage loan and pipeline and inventory of loans and securities in the amount of
$322.7 million, resulting primarily from the secondary market disruption in the latter part of the year. 
        During
2007, we incurred a loss on sale of Nonprime Mortgage Loans amounting to $269.5 million compared to a gain of $703.7 million in the prior year. This decline is due
to lower sales volume 
78



 

combined
with decreased margins on such sales. Also contributing to the decline were write-downs of the mortgage loan pipeline and inventory of loans and securities of $546.9 million primarily
resulting from the secondary market disruption in 2007 and from the transfer of Nonprime Mortgage Loans held for sale to the loans held for investment portfolio in the first quarter of 2007. The loans
transferred to loans held for investment had declined in value as a result of deteriorating market conditionsspecifically higher investor yield requirements as well as increased loss
assumptionsduring the first quarter of 2007. The negative effect of this write-down was partially offset by a $104.2 million gain in credit default swaps, used to
moderate credit spread risk. 
        During
2007, we incurred a loss on sale of Prime Home Equity Loans of $305.1 million compared to a gain of $610.8 million in 2006. The decline in revenues is due to lower
sales volume and decreased margins on such sales combined with write-downs of $592.1 million resulting primarily from the secondary market disruption in 2007. 

 Capital Markets Segment 

        During 2007, conduit gain on sale decreased compared to 2006 due to a reduction in the volume of loans sold combined with decreased margins on such sales and
write-downs of inventory, partially offset by gains of $306.6 million from credit default swaps used to moderate credit spread risk. 
        During
2007, both our securities trading and underwriting revenues were negatively impacted by declines in values of the securities sold combined with a decline in volume.

        The
increase in net interest income from the Banking Segment was attributable to growth in the amount of average interest-earning assets and to an increase in the net interest margin.
Average interest-earning assets in the Banking Segment increased to $92.1 billion during 2007, an increase of $8.1 billion, or 10%, over 2006. Net interest margin in the Banking Segment
increased to 2.33% during 2007, from 2.22% during the prior year primarily as a result of a smaller interest rate repricing lag compared to the prior year as well as the segment's portfolio containing
a smaller proportion of pay-option ARM loans with reduced introductory interest rates. These positive factors were partially offset by a shift in asset mix to include a larger portion of
lower-yielding high-credit quality mortgage-backed securities. 
79



 
        The
decrease in net interest income from the Mortgage Banking Segment loans and securities reflects a decrease in the balance of average interest-earning assets resulting from lower
mortgage loan production, and a slight decline in net interest margin from the prior year. The Mortgage Banking Segment loan and securities inventory is primarily financed with borrowings tied to
short-term indices. During the current year the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates was smaller than in the prior year, causing the decrease
in net interest margin. 
        Interest
income on custodial balances is reduced by the interest we are required to pass through to security holders on paid-off loans, which was $336.4 million and
$308.1 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively, resulting in a decline in net interest income from custodial balances. 
        Interest
expense allocated to the Loan Servicing Sector increased primarily due to an increase in total Loan Servicing Sector assets. 
        The
increase in net interest income from the Capital Markets securities inventory is attributable to an increase in the net interest margin from 0.17% during 2006 to 0.19% during 2007,
combined with a 2% increase in the average inventory of securities held. 
        The
increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to higher losses incurred in our portfolio of loans held for investment driven by the impact of the weakening housing
market and significant tightening of available credit on delinquency and default trends as well as portfolio seasoning. The impact was most significant on Prime Home Equity Loans and
pay-option loans held in our investment portfolio in Banking Operations.

(1)Includes
contractually specified servicing fees. 
        The
increase in servicing fees, net of guarantee fees, was principally due to an 11% increase in the average servicing portfolio, combined with an increase in the overall annualized net
service fee earned from 0.320% of the average portfolio balance during 2006 to 0.340% during 2007. 
        The
decrease in income from retained interests was due primarily to a reduction in the average yield on such instruments from 21% during 2006 to 17% during 2007, partially offset by a
22% increase in the average investment in these assets from 2006 to 2007. Income from retained interests excludes any impairment charges or recoveries, which are included in impairment of retained
interests in the consolidated statement of operations. These investments include interest-only, principal-only, certain mortgage pass-through and residual
securities that arise from the securitization of mortgage loans, primarily Nonprime Mortgage and Prime Home Equity Loans. 
80



 

 Realization of Expected Cash Flows from Mortgage Servicing Rights  

        The change in fair value of MSRs that is included in operations during 2007 and 2006 consists of two primary componentsa reduction in fair value due
to the realization of expected cash flows from the MSRs and a change in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates and other market factors. The realization of expected cash flows from MSRs
resulted in a value reduction of $3,012.3 million and $2,932.7 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. 

 Change in Fair Value of Mortgage Servicing Rights  

        We recorded a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs in 2007 of $1,085.4 million, primarily as a result of decreasing mortgage rates during the last half
of the year which increased expected future prepayment speeds of our agency servicing portfolio. The impact of decreasing interest rates on expected future prepayments in other products was moderated
by lower levels of housing turnover and lesser refinance activity due to weakening housing market conditions, reduced secondary market liquidity and significant tightening of available credit.
Mortgage rates increased during 2006, and as a result we recorded an increase in the fair value of the MSRs of $171.2 million.

        In
2007, we recognized impairment of credit-sensitive retained interests of $2,303.8 million, including $1,928.9 million related to subordinated interests on prime home
equity securitizations and $381.9 million related to nonprime and related residual interests. The impairment on prime home equity securitizations consists of impairment of retained interests of
$1,224.8 million and impairment losses of $704.1 million related to estimated future draw obligations on the securitizations that have entered or are presently expected to enter rapid
amortization status. These impairment charges were the result of the effect of increased estimates for future losses on the loans underlying these securities driven by weakening housing market
conditions and significant tightening of available credit. The loss estimate, as measured by gross undiscounted losses embedded in the valuation of subordinated interests as a percentage of the unpaid
principal balance of the loans underlying such interests, increased from 3.0% to 11.0% from 2006 to 2007. In addition, increased market yield requirements for these securities contributed to the
decline in their value. 
        In
2006, impairment of credit-sensitive retained interests was primarily the result of a decline in the value of certain nonprime securities due to compression of the interest rate
spread on the residuals we hold because the interest on the collateral is fixed-rate while the pass-through rate is floating. 
        In
2007, impairment of the non credit-sensitive retained interests was related to interest-only and principal-only securities and prepayment penalty bonds
together with senior and mezzanine securities that we began retaining as a result of the market disruption during 2007. The impairment in the current year is due mainly to a reduction in value of
prepayment penalty bonds resulting from slower prepayments combined with a decrease in the value of senior and mezzanine securities due to credit 
81



 

spread
widening in the marketplace. These declines were partially offset by an increase in the value of the interest-only securities caused by lower investor yield requirements. 
        In
2006, impairment of non credit-sensitive retained interests was related primarily to interest-only securities caused primarily by an increase in market yields required on
these securities. 

 Servicing Hedge Gains/Losses  

        The Servicing Hedge is designed to supplement the macro hedge and to offset a portion of the change in value of MSRs and retained interests recorded in the
current year. The values of the derivatives and securities that are the primary components of the Servicing Hedge are tied to long-term mortgage, swap and Treasury rates. Overall, these
rates decreased during 2007. We supplemented these instruments with credit default swaps to moderate a negative impact on earnings caused by credit spread-driven declines in fair value during the
early part of the year. During this period, credit spreads widened, resulting in a gain related to the credit default swaps. The Servicing Hedge produced a gain of $1,671.9 million, including a
$57.2 million gain related to the credit default swaps, net of $763 million of time value decay of the options included in the Servicing Hedge (our ""hedge cost""). During 2006, the
Servicing Hedge incurred a loss of $613.7 million, including $476 million of hedge cost. 
        In
a stable interest rate environment, we expect to incur no significant declines in value of MSRs other than recovery of our investment through the realization of cash flows. However,
we expect to incur hedge cost. The level of Servicing Hedge gains or losses in any period depends on various factors such as the size and composition of the hedge, the shape of the yield curve and the
level of implied interest rate volatility. 

 Net Insurance Premiums Earned  

        An increase in premiums earned on the lender-placed lines of business, along with an increase in reinsurance premiums earned, contributed to the
$352.1 million increase in net insurance premiums earned.

        Compensation
expense reductions occurred in the Mortgage Banking and Capital Markets Segments, as well as in Corporate Administration. 


In
the Mortgage Banking Segment, compensation expenses decreased $166.5 million, or 5%, before deferral of loan origination costs. The decrease came from the Loan
Production Sector, where compensation expenses decreased $245.0 million, or 8%, because of a change in channel mix, which reduced production-related compensation costs, coupled with a 5%
decrease in average staff due to the decrease in production volume. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $49.9 million in the Loan Servicing Sector due to continuing growth in
the servicing portfolio and rising delinquencies and an increase of $28.6 million in the Loan Closing Services Sector due to an increase in average headcount in the appraisal and title and
default business due to increased foreclosure activity.
In
Corporate Administration, compensation expense reductions primarily related to reductions in stock-based compensation and pension expenses as well as to reduced staffing
levels.
In
the Capital Markets Segment, compensation expense decreased by $16.6 million mainly due to decrease in incentive compensation, which is mostly tied to this
Segment's revenues. 

        Incremental
direct costs associated with the origination of loans are deferred when incurred. Subsequent treatment of these costs is based on whether the loans are held for sale or held
for investment. If the loan is sold, the costs deferred are included as a component of gain on sale in the period sold; if the loan is held for investment, the deferred costs are amortized to interest
income over 
83



 

the
life of the loan. Deferral of loan origination costs decreased due to a decrease in the volume of loans produced.

        During
2007, occupancy and other office expenses increased by 9%, or $96.1 million, reflecting restructuring costs and the opening of 96 Banking Operations financial centers. 

 Insurance Claim Expenses  

        Insurance claim expenses were $525.0 million during 2007 as compared to $449.1 million for the prior year. The increase in insurance claim expenses
was driven by growth in earned premiums and a $30.5 million increase in catastrophe losses in comparison to 2006. The increase was partially offset by a $74.0 million reversal of loss
reserves related to the 2003 reinsurance book of business, on which negligible remaining loss exposure was deemed to exist in 2007 compared to a reversal of $6.3 million of loss reserves
related to the 2002 reinsurance book of business in 2006. 

 Advertising and Promotion Expenses  

        Advertising and promotion expenses increased 23% from 2006, as a result of the increasing competition for lending business as mortgage market volumes decline.

Results of Operations ComparisonYear Ended December 31, 2006 (""2006"") and Year Ended December 31, 2005 (""2005"")     

 Consolidated Earnings Performance  

        Net earnings for 2006 were $2,674.8 million, a 6% increase from 2005. Our diluted earnings per share were $4.30, a 5% increase from the prior year. 
        The
increase in our earnings resulted primarily from the Banking Segment, which produced pre-tax earnings of $1,380.4 million, an increase of 28% from the prior year;
and our Capital Markets Segment, which produced pre-tax earnings of $553.5 million, an increase of 23% from the prior year. The increase in profitability of our Banking Segment was
primarily due to a 31% increase in average interest-earning assets in Banking Operations from the prior year. The increase in profitability of our Capital Markets Segment was due to increased revenue
from all sources. 
        The
increase in earnings from our Banking and Capital Market Segments was partially offset by a decrease in the profitability of our Mortgage Banking Segment, which produced
pre-tax earnings of $2,062.4 million for 2006, a decrease of 15% from 2005. The decrease in the profitability of
our Mortgage Banking Segment was primarily due to a decline in the profitability of our Loan Production Sector, as the increase in revenues from higher gain on sale margins was more than offset by
increased operating expenses as the Company continued to build its production capacity.

offset by an increase in our market share.

        Revenues
(in dollars and expressed as a percentage of mortgage loans produced) increased from 2005 primarily driven by improved Prime Mortgage revenues resulting from improved secondary
market executions on pay-option ARM loans, partially offset by the effect of continuing competitive pressure on Nonprime Mortgage Loans and Prime Home Equity Loans gain on sale. In 2006
and 2005, $403.0 billion and $411.8 billion of mortgage loans, respectively, or 96% of Mortgage Banking loan production in each period, was sold. 
        Expenses
(in dollars and as a percentage of loans produced) increased from the prior year, primarily due to costs incurred to support our investment in expanding the loan sales force and
distributed branch network in furtherance of our long-term strategy of market share growth. In addition, a lower deferral rate of expenses under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 91, Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases,
contributed to the increase in expenses.

        Pre-tax
earnings before credit-sensitive retained interests in the Loan Servicing Sector were $754.8 million during 2006, a decrease of $175.9 million from
2005. The decrease is primarily due to valuation changes, net of Servicing Hedge and increased interest expense offset by an improvement in operating revenues. The increase in interest expense was
driven by a larger average investment in Servicing Sector assets, increased leverage on those assets and increased cost of debt. The increase in operating revenues was due mainly to a larger portfolio
and higher escrow balance benefit resulting from an increase in the escrow earnings rate. Loan Servicing Sector was positively impacted by a reduction in impairment of credit-sensitive retained
interests of $166.3 million as compared to 2005. 
        As
a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156Accounting for Servicing of Financial
Assets (""SFAS 156""), MSRs are carried at fair value with the change in value recorded in current period earnings. The primary factors causing a change in fair value of
MSRs are changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, primarily due to changes in interest rates and other market factors (shown as ""Change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights""
in the preceding table) and realization of expected cash flows from MSRs.

 Loan Closing Services Sector  

        The LandSafe companies produced $91.5 million in pre-tax earnings in 2006, representing a decrease of 13% from 2005. The decrease in LandSafe's
pre-tax earnings was primarily due to the decline in loan production. 
Banking Segment  
        Banking Operations sources the loan production for its investment portfolio from the Mortgage Banking production channels and through purchases from nonaffiliated
entities. Following is a summary of Banking Operations' loan acquisitions by source:

(1)Includes
provision for loan losses plus provision for losses on unfunded loan commitments.
(2)Non-interest
expense, including mortgage insurance expense, divided by the sum of net interest income plus non-interest income. The Banking Operations'
efficiency ratio reflects the expense structure resulting from its relationship with CHL but does not include allocated corporate expenses. If the Banking Operations were a stand-alone entity, the
nature and amount of its expenses would differ from those reported. For example, the fulfillment fees paid by Countrywide Bank to the Loan Production Sector for origination costs incurred on
investment mortgage loans funded by Countrywide Bank are generally determined on an incremental cost basis which is less than would be incurred in an arms-length transaction. 
        The
Banking Operation's provision for credit losses increased by $75.2 million during 2006 compared to 2005. This increase reflects increased delinquencies and loss levels
resulting from seasoning of loans acquired during the past years of rapid portfolio growth, as well as prevailing real estate and market conditions. In addition, current portfolio growth has also
contributed to the increase in the provision for credit losses. The increase in the Banking Operation's provision for credit losses is partially offset by provision reductions which occur when the
Bank requires the Mortgage Banking Segment to purchase loans sourced by the Production Sector for underwriting or processing defects or other matters. The provision for credit losses and the related
allowance for credit losses is impacted by many factors, including economic conditions (for example, housing prices, interest rates and unemployment rates), the borrower's credit profile, the loan's
payment requirements, delinquency, loan seasoning and prepayments. Non-interest expense increased $72.2 million reflecting Banking Operations' continuing growth and increased
purchases of mortgage insurance for its portfolio of loans held for investment.

        The
increase in net interest income is primarily due to a $19.1 billion or 31% increase in average interest-earning assets, combined with a 14 basis point increase in net interest
margin. The increase in the net interest margin from the prior year was a result of the reduced impact of teaser rates earned on recently funded pay-option ARM loans owing to the reduced
level of additions in 2006 combined with an increase in the proportion of the non-interest bearing liabilities and equity used to finance interest-earning assets. These benefits were
partially offset by an increase in 2006 in the repricing lag between the LIBOR rates to which most of the Banking Operations' liabilities are indexed and the MTA index (12-month Treasury
Average) to which an increasing percentage of its assets are indexed.

        The
Banking Segment also includes the operations of CWL. CWL's pre-tax earnings decreased by $33.9 million during 2006, in comparison to the prior year,
primarily due to a 31% or $1.9 billion decrease in average mortgage warehouse advances, which resulted primarily from a decrease in overall market funding activity. Warehouse lending advances

        During
2006, the Capital Markets Segment generated revenues totaling $394.6 million from its conduit activities, primarily managing the acquisition and sale or securitization of
loans on behalf of the Mortgage Banking Segment. Conduit revenues for the reporting period increased 31% in comparison to 2005 because of an increase in volume and margins of
adjustable-rate products offset by a decline in margins on nonprime products. 
        Underwriting
revenues increased $22.9 million over the prior year because of increased securitization volume, primarily adjustable-rate products. 
        Securities
trading revenue increased 23% over the prior year due to an increase in trading margins and volume, partially offset by lower net interest income due to a tightening of net
spreads resulting from the flattening and inversion of the yield curve. 
        During
2006, the commercial real estate finance activities of the Capital Markets Segment generated revenues totaling $104.0 million primarily from sales of Commercial Real Estate
Loans compared to $67.3 million in 2005. The increase in revenue was due to an increase in the volume of loans sold and an increase in net interest income related to a higher balance in loan
inventory partially offset by a decrease in margins resulting from price competition and a change in the mix of loans sold.

        Our
mortgage reinsurance business produced $215.5 million in pre-tax earnings, an increase of 21% over the prior year, driven primarily by an increase of 15% in the
mortgage loans included in our loan servicing portfolio that are covered by reinsurance contracts and an increase in the reinsurance premium rate earned. 
        Our
Life and Casualty insurance business produced pre-tax earnings of $138.5 million, an increase of $114.6 million from the prior year. The increase in
earnings was driven by a 23% increase in net earned premiums in 2006 over 2005, and by a decrease in catastrophe losses of $98.5 million from 2005. The increase in net earned premiums was
primarily attributable to an increase in voluntary homeowners and auto insurance and to a lesser extent an increase in lender-placed insurance. Insurance claim expenses decreased as a percentage of
net earned premiums primarily due to a reduction in hurricane related claims in the current year as compared to the prior year. 
Global Operations Segment  
        Global Operations pre-tax earnings totaled $28.6 million during 2006, a decrease of $6.7 million from 2005. The decrease in earnings was
primarily due to the termination of the joint venture with Barclays Bank, PLC.

(1)Includes
loans sourced from the Mortgage Banking Segment.
(2)Gain
on sale as a percentage of loans sold. 
        The increase in Capital Markets' gain on sale related to its conduit activities was due to increased sales of mortgage loans and improved margins.
The increase in Capital Markets' gain on sale related to its commercial real estate activities was due to an increase in sales, partially offset by a decrease in margins resulting from price
competition and a change in the mix of products sold. Capital Markets' revenues from its securities trading activities consist of gain on sale and interest income. In a steep yield curve environment,
net interest income will comprise a larger percentage of total securities trading revenue. As the yield curve flattens and inverts, the mix of revenues will shift toward gain on sale of securities.
During 2006, the yield curve was flatter than in 2005 and was inverted during part of the year, which resulted in a shift in trading revenues from interest income to gain on sale.

        Gain
on sale of Prime Mortgage Loans increased in 2006, as compared to 2005, due primarily to higher margins, primarily on the sale of pay-option ARM loans, partially offset
by decreased sales. 
        Gain
on sale of Nonprime Mortgage Loans decreased in 2006, as compared to 2005, due primarily to decreased sales of such loans and lower margins resulting from increased pricing
competition. 
        Gain
on sale of Prime Home Equity Loans decreased in 2006, as compared to 2005, due primarily to reduced margins on such loans resulting from increased pricing competition that more than
offset increased sales of such loans.

        The
increase in net interest income from the Banking Segment was attributable to both growth in the average investment in mortgage loans and an increase in net interest margin. Average
assets in the 
101



 

Banking
Segment increased to $84.0 billion during 2006, an increase of $17.1 billion, or 26%, over 2005. Net interest margin increased to 2.22% during 2006, from 2.05% during 2005. 
        The
decrease in net interest income from Mortgage Banking Segment loans and securities reflects a decrease in net interest margin partially offset by an increase in average balances from
the prior year. The Mortgage Banking Segment loan and securities inventory is primarily financed with borrowings tied to short-term indices. The flattening and inversion of the yield curve
reduced the net interest margin. 
        Net
interest income from custodial balances increased in the current year primarily due to an increase in the earnings rate from 3.26% during 2005, to 5.18% during 2006, and to a lesser
extent to an increase of $445.7 million, or 2%, in average custodial balances over the prior year. Interest income on custodial balances is reduced by the interest we are required to pass
through to security holders on paid-off loans. We are required to pass through a full month's interest to security holders on paid-off loans, regardless of the payoff date, at
the underlying security rates, which were substantially higher than the short-term rates earned by us on the payoff float. The amount of such interest passed through to the security
holders was $308.1 million and $343.2 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
        Interest
expense allocated to the Loan Servicing Sector increased primarily due to the effect of rising interest rates, combined with an increase in total Servicing Sector assets and
increased leverage of those assets. 
        The
decrease in net interest income from the Capital Markets' securities portfolio is attributable to a decrease in the net interest margin from 0.36% in 2005 to 0.17% in 2006, partially
offset by an increase of 18% in the average inventory of securities held. The decrease in the net interest margin earned on the securities portfolio is primarily due to the flattening and inversion of
the yield curve. The decline in net interest income was offset by an increase in gain on sale of loans. 
        The
increase in the provision for loan losses is due to the continuing growth and seasoning of the Banking Segment's loan portfolio. In addition, deteriorating credit performance of
loans held for investment in our Mortgage Banking Segment during 2006 contributed to the increase in the provision for loan losses. A significant portion of these loans have been liquidated or written
down and transferred to held for sale as evidenced by an increase in Mortgage Banking Segment charge-offs during 2006. For further discussion of credit risk see the section in this report
entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCredit Risk Management.

        The increase in servicing fees, net of guarantee fees, was principally due to a 24% increase in the average servicing portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the overall annualized
net service fee earned from 0.333% of the average portfolio balance during 2005, to 0.320% during 2006. 
        The
increase in income from retained interests was due primarily to a 22% increase in the average investment in these assets, partially offset by a reduction in the average yield from
22% to 21%. Income from retained interests excludes any impairment charges or recoveries, which are included in impairment of retained interests in the consolidated statements of operations. These
investments include interest-only, principal-only and residual securities that arise from the securitization of mortgage loans, primarily Nonprime Mortgage and Prime Home
Equity Loans. 

 Realization of Expected Cash Flows from Mortgage Servicing Rights  

        Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted SFAS 156 and elected to carry our MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. The
change in fair value of the MSRs that is included in earnings for 2006 consists of two primary componentsa reduction in fair value due to the realization of expected cash flows from the
MSRs and a change in value resulting from changes in discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions, primarily due to changes in interest rates, and other market factors. The realization of expected
cash flows from MSRs during 2006 resulted in a value reduction of $2,932.7 million. 

 Change in Fair Value of Mortgage Servicing Rights  

        We recorded an increase in the fair value of the MSRs in 2006 of $171.2 million primarily as a result of the increase in mortgage rates during the period. 

 Amortization of Mortgage Servicing Rights  

        We recorded amortization of MSRs of $2,288.4 million, or an annual rate of 20.8%, during 2005. The amortization rate of the MSRs was dependent on the
forecasted prepayment speeds at the beginning of the period. 

 Recovery of Mortgage Servicing Rights  

        During 2005, we recovered previously recorded impairment of MSRs of $387.9 million, primarily driven by an increase in mortgage interest rates during the
period.

        In
2006, we recognized impairment of retained interests of $284.7 million. The collateral underlying certain of the retained interests (residual securities) is
fixed-rate for a defined period of time while the pass-through rate is floating. An increase in projected short-term interest rates during the period caused
compression of the spread on such residuals, which resulted in a decline in their value. Our interest-only securities also decreased in value, caused primarily by an increase in market
yields required on these securities. 
103



 
        In
2005, we recognized impairment of retained interests of $364.5 million largely due to the compression of the spread on our residual securities. 

 Servicing Hedge Losses  

        The Servicing Hedge is designed to supplement the macro hedge and to offset a portion of the change in value of MSRs and retained interests caused by changes in
interest rates recorded in current period earnings. The values of the derivatives that are the primary components of the Servicing Hedge are tied to long-term Treasury, Eurodollar,
mortgage and swap rate indices. During 2006, the Servicing Hedge incurred a loss of $613.7 million, including $476 million of hedge costs of the options included in the Servicing Hedge.
During 2005, the Servicing Hedge incurred a loss of $523.1 million, including $564 million of hedge cost. 
        In
a stable interest rate environment, we expect to incur no significant declines in value of MSRs other than recovery of our investment through the realization of cash flows. However,
we expect to incur expenses related to the hedge costs. The level of Servicing Hedge gains or losses in any period depends on various factors such as the size and composition of the hedge, the shape
of the yield curve and the level of implied interest rate volatility. 

 Net Insurance Premiums Earned  

        Net insurance premiums earned increased $217.8 million as a result of increases in voluntary homeowners and auto insurance as well as lender-placed
property lines of business along with an increase in reinsurance premiums earned.

        In
the Loan Production Sector, compensation expenses increased $65.0 million, or 2%, prior to the deferral of loan origination costs, because of a 15% increase in average staff to
support our long-term objective of market share growth. 
        In
the Loan Servicing Sector, compensation expense increased $59.6 million, or 20%, to accommodate a 10% increase in the number of loans serviced as well as an increased focus on
customer satisfaction and on regulatory compliance. Compensation expenses increased $388.1 million in most other business segments and corporate areas, reflecting growth in the Company. 
        Incremental
direct costs associated with the origination of loans are deferred when incurred. Subsequent treatment of these costs is based on whether the loans are held for sale or held
for investment. If the loan is sold, the costs deferred are included as a component of gain on sale in the period sold; if the loan is held for investment, the deferred costs are amortized to interest
income over the life of the loan. Deferral of loan origination costs decreased due to a decline in the volume of loans produced and a decrease in the deferral rate during 2006.

 Insurance Claim Expenses  

        Insurance claim expenses were $449.1 million for 2006 as compared to $441.6 million for the prior year. The change in insurance claim expenses
reflects the growth in our insurance book of business offset by a $98.5 million reduction in catastrophe claim expenses. 

 Advertising and Promotion Expenses  

        Advertising and promotion expenses increased 14% from 2005 as a result of a shift in the mortgage loan production market. Purchase activity, which was more
prevalent in 2006, generally requires more advertising and promotion than refinance activity, which is customarily driven by increased consumer demand for mortgages resulting from low interest rates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources     
        We meet our financing requirements using a combination of debt and equity capital. Our short-term financing needs arise primarily from our holding of
mortgage loans pending sale, the trading activities of our broker-dealer and our warehouse lending business. Our long-term financing needs arise primarily from our investments in our
mortgage loan portfolio, MSRs and retained interests and the financial instruments acquired to manage the interest rate risk associated with those investments. The structure and mix of our debt and
equity capital are primarily driven by our strategic objectives but are also influenced by regulatory and credit rating agency requirements as well as capital markets conditions. These factors affect
the type of financing we are able to obtain and the rate at which we are able to grow. 
        Our
primary sources of debt include deposits taken by our Bank, FHLB advances, the public corporate debt markets, unsecured bank lines, repurchase agreements and the secondary mortgage
market. Our primary source of equity capital is retained earnings. From time to time, we may issue common or preferred stock, subordinated debt or other high-equity content securities as a
means of increasing our capital base and supporting our growth. To this end, in the third quarter we issued 20,000 shares of 7.25% Series B non-voting convertible preferred stock,
par value $0.05 per share, for an aggregate price of $2.0 billion. The preferred stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to payment of dividends and distribution upon liquidation.
We also have $2.2 billion outstanding in junior subordinated debentures that receive varying degrees of ""equity treatment"" from rating agencies, bank lenders and regulators. In addition, we
have a $5.9 billion deferred tax liability related to our MSRs that would offset a portion of any realized loss in the value of our MSRs, and which is generally offset against our MSRs in
determining our capital requirements. 
        In
connection with a share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, we entered into an agreement to purchase 60.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock
for an aggregate purchase price of $2.4 billion under an accelerated share repurchase program. The transaction was subject to a market price adjustment payment based on the actual
volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the repurchase period. The price adjustment payment was settled, at our election by the delivery to us of an additional 124,512 shares of our
common stock in the second quarter of 2007. 

 Liquidity Management  

        Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets at prices approximating
book value or obtain adequate funding because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions. We manage our liquidity on a legal entity basis, as appropriate, due to debt covenants and regulatory
requirements. 
        We
have developed a comprehensive Liquidity Management Plan (""LMP"") to moderate liquidity risk with the goal of maintaining adequate, appropriate and cost-effective sources
of liquidity under all market conditions. A key element of the LMP is the requirement that we maintain sufficient sources of contingent liquidity to fund our business in the event of market
disruptions of varying severities and duration. Contingent liquidity sources include credit facilities or financing programs under which our creditors are committed to fund in a stressed environment
or are otherwise deemed to be reliable. They also include highly liquid, unencumbered assets that can be converted to cash, via sale or financing, within 30 days. 
        Another
key element of the LMP is to finance our assets in a manner consistent with their liquidity profile. Liquid assets are those that can be liquidated within 30 days under
all market conditions by sale (at prices no less than values reported on our balance sheet prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) or are readily able to be financed.
These assets primarily consist of mortgage loans held for sale, trading securities, available-for-sale securities and warehouse advance lines. Liquid assets are financed using a combination of
committed warehouse financing 
107



 

programs
including unsecured and secured revolving lines of credit, federal funds, repurchase agreements and short-term deposits. 
        Less
liquid assets are those that are not readily saleable into active markets or, as in the case of our investments in mortgage loans, are not intended to be sold. These assets
primarily consist of mortgage loans held for investment, MSRs and retained interests. Less liquid assets are financed with long-term capital, which we define for this purpose as equity and
debt, including long-term deposits, with a maturity greater than six months. 
        We
regularly forecast our potential operating cash needs over a rolling twelve-month horizon, taking into account, among other things, loan commitments, debt maturities and potential
peak balance sheet levels under several interest rate scenarios. We also forecast our potential operating cash needs in various stress scenarios to determine our contingent liquidity needs. Based on
these forecasts, we size our existing financing programs and, if necessary, establish new ones to meet expected future operating cash requirements. The forecasts are also used to size our contingent
liquidity sources, which are credit
facilities or financing programs under which our creditors are committed to fund or depositors are expected to participate. 
        Our
ability to finance our operations is subject to the risk that expected sources of financing become unavailable to us because of market events or of changing perceptions of
Countrywide's creditworthiness. For example, in the event our credit ratings were to drop below ""investment grade,"" our access to the public corporate debt markets could be severely limited and our
ability to attract and retain commercial deposits and arrange other sources of financing would become constrained. 
        Liquidity
risk was highlighted during the second half of 2007, when the non-agency segments of the secondary mortgage market were severely restricted by illiquidity driven by
wider credit spreads. The commercial paper and repurchase agreement segments of the public corporate debt markets were also severely restricted, particularly for mortgage companies and other financial
institutions. These conditions have not abated through the date of this Report. 
        In
response to severe disruption in the secondary mortgage market and short-term and unsecured debt markets in the second half of 2007, we took the following actions to enhance our
liquidity and capital position: 


Accelerated
the integration of our mortgage banking activities into our bank subsidiary which has access to stable, non-capital markets based funding
Significantly
changed our underwriting standards to focus the majority of our loan production on loans that are available for direct sale to or securitization into programs
sponsored by the government-sponsored agencies
Modified
our funding structure by significantly reducing our reliance on the public debt and non-agency secondary mortgage markets and instead relied on our
reliable contingent liquidity sources to fund our business, including drawing the full $11.5 billion amount of our committed revolving credit facilities established to provide liquidity in the
event of a disruption in the commercial paper market. 

        As
a result of these changes, our funding structure has evolved such that it more closely resembles that of a thrift holding company rather than that of a finance company with a banking
subsidiary. 
        We
believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our obligations, includingbut not limited toour commitments to lend, maturities of debt and obligations to
fund rapid amortization events. At December 31, 2007, we estimate that we have available liquidity totaling $36.6 billion. We classify a facility as reliable when the facility is
provided by a government-sponsored enterprise or when it is contractually committed to us and we have paid a commitment fee in exchange for the facility. While current market conditions present
challenges to us, the funding structure that we have migrated toward has allowed us to change our sources of funding away from those that have higher refinancing risk toward more stable and reliable
sources such as deposits and FHLB advances. We supplement these 
108



 
sources
with committed secured and unsecured revolving credit facilities provided by highly rated banks. 

 Deposit Liabilities  

        We offer both retail and commercial deposit accounts which provide an important source of liquidity to us. These deposits are sourced through our banking centers,
call centers, website and through deposit brokers and our in-house sales force. To enhance our deposit gathering activities following the disruption in the public debt and secondary
mortgage markets, we opened 95 new banking centers during the year ended December 31, 2007. 
        As
of December 31, 2007, our deposit balances were $60.2 billion, $12.6 billion of which were custodial funds that relate to our loan servicing portfolio. 

 Federal Home Loan Bank Advances  

        Our Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta and is able to participate in certain member financing programs. Under these programs, we typically pledge a security
interest in certain mortgage loans to the FHLB in exchange for financing. The amount the FHLB advances against the collateral varies depending on the lien status of the mortgages securing the advance.
The FHLB also requires that we purchase a certain percentage of its stock for every dollar we borrow. Our current stock purchase requirement is equal to 0.2% of the Bank's assets up to a maximum of
$25.0 million, plus 4.5% of total advances we have outstanding with the FHLB. 
        Our
FHLB advances generally have maturities of 1-5 years, consistent with the weighted average expected life of our mortgage loans held for investment. Our access to
such financing is currently limited to no more than 50% of our Bank's ending assets for the prior month. The FHLB's financing support is uncommitted and requests for additional advances are evaluated
at the time they are received. Our funding capacity is also uncommitted and may be reduced to less than 50% of the Bank's ending assets of the prior month at the FHLB's discretion. While we normally
consider uncommitted financing programs to be less reliable sources of funding, given the FHLB's status as a government sponsored entity and its mandate to provide a stable source of funds to support
the residential mortgage market, we classify FHLB advances as a reliable source of contingent liquidity. As of December 31, 2007, we believe that we were in compliance with the FHLB stock
purchase and collateral requirements. 

 Unsecured Public Corporate Debt Markets  

        The public corporate debt markets have historically been a key source of financing for us, due to their efficiency and low cost. We have accessed these markets by
issuing unsecured commercial paper and unsecured medium-term notes. We also have issued unsecured convertible debt, subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures. At
December 31, 2007, we had a total of $26.3 billion in public corporate debt outstanding. 
        Following
the disruptions in the public debt and secondary mortgage markets and our related liquidity constraints in August of 2007, the major credit agencies downgraded our debt
ratings. While we have maintained investment grade ratings, at our current short-term ratings the public corporate debt markets are no longer a practical source of short-term
inventory financing. Our access to the public debt markets has also been restricted by the substantial increase in credit spreads for all participants in the U.S. mortgage market.

(1)On
January 11, 2008, following the announcement of our pending acquisition by Bank of America, all three rating agencies placed our ratings on some form of positive watch to
reflect the likely upgrade to our ratings following completion of the Merger. 
        In the event of a ratings downgrade below investment grade, the cost of access to the unsecured public corporate debt markets would increase to
levels that would make this source of funds unattractive to us if and when the current disruption abates. Furthermore, we would likely be unable to retain all of our existing bank credit commitments
beyond the then-existing maturity dates. Consequently, our relative cost of financing would rise significantly and we would find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage in pursuing some of
our capital-intensive activities, such as our ongoing investment in our portfolio of mortgage loans held for investment, MSRs and retained interests. Investment grade ratings are also important to
counterparties with which we engage in normal-course trading and financing activities and our ratings affect the availability and cost of credit extensions for such activities, as well as impacting
our retention of escrow and commercial deposits. 

 Unsecured Commercial Paper  

        Due to current market conditions and our current short-term credit ratings, the unsecured commercial paper market is not currently a viable source of
funding for us. As of December 31, 2007, we had no commercial paper outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2007, our average unsecured commercial paper outstanding totaled
$4.8 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2006, our average unsecured commercial paper outstanding totaled $6.8 billion. 

 Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Market  

        From early 2003 through August 2007, the asset-backed commercial paper market was one of our most significant sources of funding. We formed two special purpose
entities (Park Granada and Park Sienna) to finance certain of our mortgage loans held for sale. The entities issued commercial paper in the form of extendible maturity short-term secured
liquidity notes (""SLNs""). In the quarter ended September 30, 2007, liquidity in the extendible SLN segment of the commercial paper market became so severely constrained that it is no longer a
viable market. We repaid all remaining outstanding SLNs effective October 31, 2007 and formally terminated both funding programs on December 20, 2007. 

 Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit  

        As of December 31, 2007, we had unsecured credit agreements (revolving credit facilities) with a group of commercial banks permitting us to borrow a
maximum total amount of $11.5 billion with various maturities through 2011. At December 31, 2007, we had fully utilized these facilities. No amount was outstanding under these facilities
at December 31, 2006. 
        The
terms of the credit agreements require us to maintain at all times a consolidated net worth (as calculated in conformance with GAAP) of $7.7 billion. Our actual consolidated
net worth as of December 31, 2007 was $14.7 billion. Our failure to comply with this requirement could result in termination of the facilities by the lending banks. 
110



 

 Secured Revolving Lines of Credit  

        We have formed a special purpose entity (Park Monaco) to finance inventory with funding provided by a group of commercial bank-sponsored conduits that
are financed through the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper. The entity incurs interest based on prevailing money market rates approximating the cost of asset-backed commercial paper. At
December 31, 2007, we had aggregate commitments from the banks that sponsor the conduits to provide alternative financing in the event that their respective conduits were unable to issue
asset-backed commercial paper totaling $10.4 billion and had $1.5 billion in outstanding borrowings, secured by $0.3 billion of mortgage loans held for sale and
$1.9 billion of mortgage loans held for investment. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the average borrowings under this facility totaled $1.5 billion and the weighted-average
interest rate was 5.60%. At December 31, 2007, the weighted-average interest rate was 5.47%. 
        For
the year ended December 31, 2006, the average borrowings under this facility totaled $1.0 billion and the weighted-average interest rate was 4.81%. At
December 31, 2006, the weighted-average interest rate was 5.35%. 
        In
2006, we entered into a $4.0 billion master trust facility to finance Countrywide Warehouse Lending (""CWL"") receivables backed by mortgage loans through the sale
of such receivables to a multi-asset conduit finance company financed by issuing extendible maturity asset-backed commercial paper.
Following the disruption in the extendible maturity asset-backed commercial paper segment of the public corporate debt markets, the facility was no longer viable. We terminated this facility on
October 10, 2007. 

 Repurchase Agreements  

        We also use short-term repurchase agreements as a means of financing securities and mortgage loans pending sale. To ensure continued access to this
segment of the capital markets, we have arranged to have $12.5 billion of repurchase facilities available to us on a committed basis through various maturities in 2008. 

 Secondary Mortgage Market  

        Historically, we have relied substantially on the secondary mortgage market as a source of long-term capital to support our mortgage banking
operations. Our ability to access that market is dependent on investor demand for the types of mortgage-backed securities we produce. In 2007, we saw an increase in investor required yields, first for
nonprime loans or securities followed by Prime Home Equity Loans and then non-conforming loans, together with a lessening in the liquidity of such loans and securities caused by reduced
investor demand. In the second half of the year, the secondary mortgage market for nonagency loans was virtually illiquid. In addition, certain credit rating agencies have downgraded their
securitization ratings of large numbers of mortgage-backed securities. These factors have combined to severely impact demand for a large portion of the products we have historically produced. In
response to these developments, we have tightened our underwriting and program guidelines, including reductions in the availability of reduced documentation loans and loans on investor-owned
properties and a reduction in the maximum loan-to-value or combined loan-to-value ratios. The impact of these changes was most significant to Nonprime
Mortgage, Prime Home Equity and non-conforming Prime Mortgage Loans, which significantly reduced our production of non agency-eligible loans and thereby reduced our reliance on the
secondary mortgage market as a source of financing. 
        As
a result of the changes to our underwriting and program guidelines, the vast majority of the mortgage loans that we now originate are eligible for sale directly to Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac or Ginnie Mae or for securitization into MBS guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae (collectively, ""Agency MBS""). Before the disruption in the secondary mortgage market, we also
issued non-Agency or ""private-label"" MBS and ABS. Private-label MBS and ABS are registered with the SEC and have separate credit ratings. Private-label MBS and ABS generally require some
form of credit enhancement, such as over-collateralization, senior-subordinated structures, primary mortgage insurance, Countrywide guarantees and/or private surety guarantees.

 Capital Management  

        Our capital management framework is designed to ensure that the risk-taking activities by our business are supported by an adequate capital base,
consistent with approved investment guidelines and risk tolerances. Our capital adequacy monitoring gives consideration to regulatory and rating agency requirements and to our estimated economic
capital requirements. 

 Economic Capital  

        We use economic capital concepts for assessing safety and soundness of the entire Company. We are integrating economic capital consumption into business segment
performance assessments. Business segment economic capital calculations ensure that the capital allocations are consistent, elicit disciplined risk taking, and facilitate business segment performance
comparisons by senior management. 
        We
define economic capital as the amount of capital required to absorb unexpected losses given our risk profile and risk management strategies. We estimate unexpected losses based on the
level of losses that we are likely to incur in severe scenarios. We establish the severity of the scenarios based on our risk tolerances and target credit ratings for public debt market access (""debt
market access standards""). 
        For
unhedged risks, our capital adequacy is assessed at the consolidated level. We continue to refine our economic capital calculations and improve our estimates of required capital. We
emphasize a comprehensive measurement of company-wide hedged and un-hedged risks within the context of maintaining approved debt market access targets in our capital adequacy
measurement processes. For 2008, our economic capital estimates were adjusted to reflect changes in business practices due to changing market conditions. 
        A
significant proportion of our risk management strategies and risk evaluation relies on internally developed and externally procured models. Further, in certain areas of our risk
management we use
models to establish strategies aimed at eliminating much of the risk due to fluctuations in market factors. Thus we have significant exposure to the risk that our models may be inaccurate and
therefore expose us to loss. We manage model risk throughout Countrywide using a variety of techniques including: independent reviews of model documentation and appropriateness at the time of model
development and introduction; ongoing model monitoring through back testing and validation, and benchmarking to peer models. Ongoing model performance results are reviewed at governance forums
attended by model developers and users of the models. At present, we assess model risk exposure using scenario analysis. 
        Our
estimates of economic capital rely on a combination of internally developed risk measurement methods, external models and benchmarks. We measure and hold economic capital for the
following primary risks: credit, market, operational and insurance. In addition, we explore capital sensitivity to modeling and economic uncertainty via scenario analysis. 
        Credit
risk:    This is risk of loss due to borrower defaults or declines in asset values due to changes in credit conditions. Credit capital is calculated at debt market
access standards for the unexpected losses in excess of those we have provided for in our asset valuations and reserve calculations. Our credit risk loss estimation process considers the seasoning
profile of our assets with credit risk to ensure capital sufficiency through the business cycle. Estimates of credit capital are developed separately for retail mortgage, commercial mortgage and
counterparty exposures. The amounts outstanding at the time of default (exposures at default) are constructed using a combination of historical data and forward simulation techniques and include the
use of rating agency models that are broadly used in the mortgage-backed securities market. Once the economic capital amounts are determined they are adjusted for the risk transfer benefits associated
with mortgage pool insurance policies that the Company purchases on certain loan portfolios. These pool insurance policies absorb a 
112



 

certain
portion of loan losses according to the terms of the specific policy. We estimate our credit risk as follows: 


Retail
credit risk:    We base our estimates of credit risk on projections using internal data and external models. We estimate subordination levels on the credit
portfolio using rating agency models and review subordination levels on market transactions to determine the required capital. We also review loss development under various stress scenarios to ensure
the adequacy of the capital requirement.
Commercial
credit risk:    We base our estimates of credit risk on internal data and benchmarks derived from market transactions.
Counterparty
credit risk:    For non-derivative counterparty exposures, we base our estimates of credit risk on our internal risk evaluation
assignments and capital assessments by type of exposure mapped to rating agency-style scales. We estimate our capital requirement for derivative counterparty exposures using a similar process as well
as by calculating current and potential exposure estimates using projected movements in underlying market rates. 

        Market
risk:    Market risk is the risk of loss in asset value due to variations in underlying market variables such as the yield curve and market prices, which for us is
predominately interest rate driven. We assess capital separately for our trading financial instruments, which includes the activities of Capital Markets, and the non-trading financial
instruments by computing estimates of market value loss over a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with our debt market access standards. Our assessments take into
consideration the probabilities of large movements in underlying driver variables over the one year horizon. Our estimates of value loss are calculated using internally developed and externally
sourced risk measurement technologies. Risk measurement focuses on estimating the extent of un-hedged risks. Market value changes are also developed using plausible but unlikely scenarios
and these scenarios are given consideration in the assessment of our market risk capital requirements. 


Trading
financial instruments:    We use a value-at-risk measurement to estimate the potential loss in market value of an asset to a 99%
confidence level. This estimate is scaled to reflect exposure over a one year period. Our value-at-risk measure facilitates comparisons of our market risk exposure estimates
and our daily trading results over time. We use back-testing in our trading unit to verify the predictive power of our value-at-risk calculations. In the
back-testing procedures, we compare actual profits and losses against losses indicated by the estimates from our value-at-risk model.
Non-trading
financial instruments:    We compute the aggregate market risk exposure for our non-trading financial instruments by developing
a detailed representation of our positions, and identification and modeling of the driver variables. We calculate market risk capital for the aggregated non-trading book by computing the
equivalent of a one-year value-at-risk loss estimate consistent with debt market access standards. For risk management purposes,
value-at-risk loss measurements are computed over monthly horizons and a market risk profile consistent with desired debt market access standards is maintained. We look at the
sensitivity of the non-trading financial instruments on a variety of parallel and historical scenarios to assess the vulnerabilities in the risk profile.
Stress
Testing:    While our value-at-risk estimate supplies forecasts for potentially large losses under normal market conditions, we also
perform stress tests in which we value the portfolios under stylized economic scenarios of the driver risk variables outside the value-at-risk models. We use market risk
information provided by the
stress scenarios to adjust our economic capital requirements as needed. We develop the stress scenarios using historical information and management judgment. 

113



 




        Operational
risk:    Operational risk is the risk of loss due to inadequate or failed processes or systems. We have begun the process of collecting loss data for the
development of our economic capital requirement, which is not yet complete. Until we complete the development of our operational loss estimation models, we are basing our estimates of required capital
on an approach permitted by the international Basel II accord. 
        Insurance
risk:    Insurance risk arises from unexpectedly high payouts on insurance liabilities. Our insurance operations are exposed to a variety of risks including
operational, market, counterparty and catastrophic risks. These risks arise due to our underwriting activities, portfolio investments, reinsurance transfers and exposure to catastrophic natural
disasters. The bulk of the capital allocated to the insurance business is to cover catastrophic risks, the largest component of which is hurricane risk. Our insurance operations partially manage the
risks by reinsuring portions of the risks. The reinsurance activities are considered while assessing allocated capital requirements. 
        The
following tables summarize our estimated economic capital requirements by risk category as of December 31, 2007:

        Credit
capital scenario analysis: We use scenario and stress analyses to assess portfolio vulnerabilities and to complement economic capital results. For credit exposures, we maintain a
credit risk profile that has been developed to help ensure that instantaneous erosions of housing equity, or a similar shock scenario, does not lead to increases in credit capital beyond established
risk tolerances. These equity erosion tests provide valuable information about a key source of risk exposure for the Company. 

 Regulatory Capital Requirements  

        On March 12, 2007, the Bank converted its charter from a national bank to a federal savings bank. As a result of this conversion, the Company became a
savings and loan holding company, and is no longer a bank holding company. As a savings and loan holding company, Countrywide Financial Corporation is no longer subject to specific capital
requirements. Countrywide Bank's capital is calculated in compliance with the requirements of the Office of Thrift Supervision (""OTS""), which are similar to those of the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, the Bank's former regulator. At

        Countrywide
Bank is required by OTS regulations to maintain tangible capital of at least 1.5% of assets. However, the Bank is also required to maintain a tangible equity ratio of at
least 2% to avoid being classified as ""critically undercapitalized."" Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the prompt corrective action provisions of the Financial Institution Reform
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. The Bank's tangible capital ratio was 8.0% and 7.6% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
        The
OTS has prescribed that the Company and its affiliates are not authorized to receive, and the Bank is not authorized to pay the Company or its affiliates, capital distributions
without receipt of prior written OTS non-objection. For 2008 with non-objection from the OTS, the Bank can declare dividends totaling $2.0 billion plus its net profits for 2008, up
to the date of dividend
declaration. As of December 31, 2007, the Bank's retained earnings unavailable for dividends totaled $495.1 million. 

 Cash Flow  
 Year Ended December 31, 2007 compared to 2006  

        Cash used by operating activities was $1.5 billion for 2007, compared to $3.1 billion for 2006. Cash used by operating activities includes the cash
used for the origination and purchase of mortgage loans held for sale and the proceeds from the sales and principal repayments of such mortgages. We generally retain servicing rights and may retain
other interests when these loans are sold. The recognition of the amounts retained is a non-cash investing activity. See Note 22Supplemental
Cash Flow Information in the financial statement section of this Report. In 2007, funds used to originate and purchase mortgage loans exceeded proceeds from the sales of
mortgage loans by $5.2 billion, which 
115



 
resulted
in cash used by operating activities. In 2006, proceeds from the sales and principal repayments of mortgage loans exceeded funds used to originate and purchase mortgage loans by
$5.7 billion. This decrease in cash used by operations was offset by an $11.4 billion increase in cash used to settle trading securities, which resulted in cash used by operating
activities. 
        Net
cash provided by investing activities was $7.4 billion for 2007, compared to cash used by investing activities of $14.3 billion for 2006. The increase in net cash
provided by investing activities was attributable to a $12.1 billion increase in net repayment of loans held for investment, combined with a $21.6 billion decrease in securities
purchased under agreements to resell, securities borrowed, and federal funds sold, partially offset by a $12.2 billion increase in net additions to investments in other financial instruments. 
        Net
cash provided by financing activities for 2007 totaled $1.4 billion, compared to $17.7 billion for 2006. The $1.4 billion included drawing the full
$11.5 billion of available backup credit lines we obtained to provide liquidity as a result of disruptions in the commercial paper markets. During 2007, deposit liabilities increased
$4.6 billion, compared to an increase of $16.1 billion in the prior period. In 2007, there was a $39.7 billion decrease in cash provided by short-term borrowings,
including securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Partially offsetting these decreases,
long-term debt increased $33.1 billion compared to an increase in long-term debt of $0.6 billion in 2006, and during 2007, $2 billion of preferred stock
was issued. 

 Year Ended December 31, 2006 compared to 2005  

        Cash used by operating activities was $3.1 billion for 2006, compared to $11.2 billion for 2005. Cash used by operating activities includes the cash
used for the origination and purchase of mortgage loans held for sale and the proceeds from the sales and principal repayments of such mortgages. In 2006, proceeds from the sales of mortgage loans
exceeded funds used to originate and purchase mortgage loans by $5.7 billion. This decrease in cash used by operations was offset by an $11.4 billion increase in cash used to settle
trading securities, which resulted in cash used by operating activities. In 2005, funds used to originate and purchase mortgage loans exceeded proceeds from the sales of mortgage loans by
$11.2 billion, which resulted in cash used by operating activities. 
        Net
cash used by investing activities was $14.3 billion for 2006, compared to cash used by investing activities of $42.3 billion for 2005. The decrease in net cash used in
investing activities was attributable to a $24.2 billion decrease in cash used to fund loans held for investment combined with a $5.9 billion decrease in securities purchased under
agreements to resell, securities borrowed, and federal funds sold. 
        Net
cash provided by financing activities for 2006 totaled $17.7 billion, compared to $53.8 billion for 2005. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was
comprised of an $18.6 billion net decrease in short-term borrowings, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Also contributing to the decline in net cash provided
by financing activities was the amount of net additions to long-term debt. In 2005, long-term debt increased $13.4 billion compared to an increase in
long-term debt of $0.6 billion in 2006. 
 
 
Credit Risk Management     
        A significant risk for the Company is credit risk, which is the risk that a borrower will not repay the loan's balance as agreed and the risk that the proceeds
from liquidation of the collateral securing the loan will not be adequate to repay the loan's balance. We also have credit risk that a counterparty will not perform in accordance with contractual
terms and we will not realize uncollateralized gains that have been recorded. Credit risk arises in many of our business activities including lending activities, mortgage banking, securities trading
activities and interest rate risk management activities. We balance the level of credit risk against our expected returns in determining the level of credit risk we retain. 
116



 
        Management's
Credit Committee, comprised of our Chief Risk Officer and other senior executives, has primary responsibility for setting strategies to achieve our credit risk goals and
objectives. Those goals and objectives are documented in our Credit Policy. 

 Mortgage Credit Risk  
 Overview  

        In our mortgage lending activities, we manage our credit risk through credit policy, underwriting, quality control and surveillance activities as well as through
use of credit enhancements, especially nonrecourse and limited recourse securitizations. We also employ proactive collection and loss mitigation efforts. 

 Loan Quality  

        Our credit policy establishes standards for the determination of acceptable credit risks. Those standards encompass borrower and collateral quality, underwriting
guidelines and loan origination standards and procedures. 
        Borrower
quality includes consideration of the borrower's credit and capacity to pay. We assess credit and capacity to pay through the use of credit scores, application of a mortgage
scorecard, and manual or automated underwriting. 
        We
evaluate collateral quality through the use of appraisals, property inspections and/or automated valuation models. 
        Underwriting
guidelines facilitate the uniform application of underwriting standards to all borrowers regardless of race, religion or ethnic background. Uniformity in underwriting also
provides a means for measuring and managing credit risk. 
        Our
conventional conforming underwriting guidelines are based on the guidelines accepted by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Our underwriting guidelines for FHA-insured and
VA-guaranteed mortgage loans comply with guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development or the Veterans Administration. 
        Our
underwriting guidelines for non-conforming Prime Mortgage Loans, Prime Home Equity Loans, and Nonprime Mortgage Loans have historically been designed so that these loans
are salable in the secondary mortgage market. We developed these guidelines to meet the requirements of private investors, rating agencies and third-party credit enhancement providers. However, during
the latter part of 2007, the combination of a weakening housing market and concern over certain industry-wide product offerings negatively impacted the expectations of future performance
and the value investors assign to these mortgage loans and securities. Because of this, investor demand for non-agency mortgage-backed securities abruptly declined. Mortgage lenders,
including Countrywide, responded by tightening their loan program and underwriting standards. Specifically, we have tightened our underwriting standards during 2007 to reduce the availability of loans
to borrowers with lower credit scores, reduced documentation loans and loans on investor-owned properties and to reduce the maximum loan-to-value or combined
loan-to-value ratio. 
        These
standards and procedures include underwriter qualifications and authority levels, appraisal review requirements, fraud controls, funds disbursement controls, training of our
employees and ongoing review of their work. We help to ensure that our origination standards are met by employing accomplished and seasoned management, underwriters and processors and through the
extensive use of technology. We also employ proprietary underwriting systems in our loan origination process that improve the consistency of underwriting standards, assess collateral adequacy and help
to prevent fraud, while at the same time increasing productivity. 
117



 
        We
supplement our loan origination standards and procedures with a post-funding quality control process. Our Quality Control Department is responsible for completing loan
audits that may consist of a re-verification of loan documentation, an underwriting and appraisal review, and, if necessary, a fraud investigation. We also employ a pre-and
post-funding proprietary loan performance evaluation system. This system helps to identify fraud and poor performance of individuals and business entities associated with the origination
of our loans. The combination of this system and our audit results allows us to evaluate and measure adherence to prescribed underwriting guidelines and compliance with laws and regulations. 

 Lending ActivitiesSale of Loans  

        A significant amount of the mortgage loans that we originate or purchase in our Mortgage Banking and Capital Markets Segments are sold into the secondary mortgage
markets primarily in the form of securities, and to a lesser extent as whole loans. When we sell or securitize our loans we retain varying degrees of credit risk from the continuing investments and/or
obligations we retain either in the form of credit-enhancing subordinated interests, corporate guarantees or representations and warranties issued when we sell or securitize loans and through the
structure of certain of our securitizations. 
        Our
Prime Mortgage Loans generally are sold on a non-recourse basis, while Prime Home Equity and Nonprime Mortgage Loans generally are sold with limited recourse for credit
losses. Almost all of our loan sale transactions retain credit risk in the form of the representations and warranties we provide and that are customary for loan sales transactions. 

 Securitization  

        As described below, the degree to which we retain credit risk on loans that we sell through securitizations depends on the structure of the securitization. Our
Prime Mortgage Loans generally are securitized on a non-recourse basis, while Prime Home Equity and Nonprime Mortgage Loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit
losses. 

 Conforming Conventional Loans  

        We generally pool conforming conventional loans into MBS guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Subject to certain representations and warranties we make,
nearly all conventional loans securitized through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are sold on a non-recourse basis. We pay guarantee fees to these agencies to compensate them for their
assumption of credit risk on the securitized loans. 

 FHA-Insured and VA-Guaranteed Loans  

        FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans are generally pooled into MBS guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association
(""Ginnie Mae""). We are insured against foreclosure loss by the FHA or partially guaranteed against foreclosure loss by the VA. Fees charged by the FHA and VA for assuming such risks are paid directly
by the borrower. We are exposed to credit losses on defaulted VA loans to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the VA is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred. We pay
guarantee fees to Ginnie Mae for Ginnie Mae's guarantee on its securities of timely payment of principal and interest. Ginnie Mae does not assume mortgage credit risk associated with the loans
securitized under its program. 

 Non-conforming Conventional Prime Loans  

        Non-conforming conventional prime mortgage loans are generally pooled into ""private-label"" MBS. Such securitizations involve some form of credit
enhancement such as senior/subordinated structures, including residual interests, overcollateralization or mortgage pool insurance. Securitizations that involve senior/subordinated structures contain
securities that assume varying levels of credit risk. 
118



 
Holders
of subordinated securities are compensated for the credit risk assumed through a higher yield. When we sell the subordinated securities created in connection with these securitizations we
transfer the related credit risk subject to representations and warranties we make when the loans are securitized. When we retain the subordinated securities, generally the residual interests, we are
in the first loss position; however, the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the residual securities. 
        In
some cases a portion of the retained residual interest is deposited into a net interest margin (""NIM"") security, which enables us to sell some of the future residual cash flows and
retain a smaller residual interest (""Back-end NIM Residual""). The holder of the Back-end NIM Residual is in the first loss position; however, the recourse for credit losses is
limited to the carrying value of the Back-end NIM residual. 

 Prime Home Equity Loans  

        Prime Home Equity Loans are generally pooled into private-label asset-backed securities. We generally securitize these loans with limited recourse for credit
losses through retention of residual interests and other subordinated interests, such as transferor's interests. These securities generally contain credit enhancement in the form of
over-collateralization and insurance provided by a third-party surety. In some cases, the securitizations also contain mortgage pool insurance or a limited corporate guarantee as a form of
credit enhancement. As the holder of the residual interest we are in the first loss position. We are also exposed to additional losses in home equity securitization transactions that involve insurance
issued by third party sureties when losses exceed specified levels or duration. When this condition, known as rapid amortization, occurs, the reimbursement we receive from the transfer of additional
draws on the home equity loans becomes subordinated to the claims of all other parties to the securitization, including bondholders and the third party surety. This subordination has the effect of
deferring reimbursement to us of the subsequent draws for an extended period and subjecting these subsequent draws to absorption of credit losses. 

 Nonprime Mortgage Loans  

        Nonprime Mortgage Loans are generally pooled into private-label asset-backed securities. We generally securitize these loans with limited recourse for credit
losses through retention of residual interests. The holder of the residual interest is in the first loss position; however, the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the
residual interest. In some cases, such limited recourse securitizations have contained lender-paid mortgage insurance as a form of credit enhancement or a limited corporate guarantee from
us. We also have pooled a portion of our Nonprime Mortgage Loans into securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae. In such cases, we have paid Fannie Mae a guarantee fee in exchange for Fannie Mae assuming a
portion of the credit risk of the underlying loans. 
        In
some cases a portion of the retained residual interest is deposited into a NIM security, which enables us to sell some of the future residual cash flows and retain a
Back-end NIM Residual. The holder of the Back-end NIM Residual is in the first loss position; however, the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the
Back-end NIM Residual. 

 Subordinated Interests  

        Our exposure to credit losses related to subordinated interests is limited to the assets' carrying values plus the value of additional draws we may be required to
subordinate if a rapid amortization 
119



 
event
occurs in a securitization. We carry subordinated interests at their estimated fair values. The carrying values of our subordinated interests are as follows:

obligations is recorded as a component of impairment of retained interests. The accrued liability for impairment related to future expected funding obligations under a rapid amortization event was
$704.1 million as of December 31, 2007. The available credit lines for the securitizations subject to or expected to be subject to a future draw obligation are approximately
$2.4 billion at December 31, 2007. However, due to the borrower's ability to pay down and redraw balances, a maximum obligation cannot be defined.

 Representations and Warranties  

        When we sell a loan, we make various representations and warranties relating to, among other things, the following: 


our
ownership of the loan
the
validity of the lien securing the loan
the
absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan
the
effectiveness of title insurance on the property securing the loan
the
process used in selecting the loans for inclusion in a transaction
the
loan's compliance with any applicable loan criteria (e.g., loan balance limits, property type, delinquency status) established by the buyer
the
loan's compliance with applicable local, state and federal laws. 

120



 




        The
specific representations and warranties made by us depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer. Market conditions and credit-rating agency requirements
may also affect representations and warranties and the other provisions we may agree to in loan sales. For example, in some transactions, such as sales of nonprime and second-lien loans,
we may agree to repurchase a loan if a payment default occurs within a specified period of time (e.g., 30 days) after sale. 
        In
the event of a breach of our representations and warranties, we may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans with the identified defects or indemnify the investor or
insurer. In such cases, we bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans. Our representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits. However, our contractual liability
arises only when the representations and warranties are breached and generally only when a loss results from the breach. We attempt to limit our risk of incurring these losses by structuring our
operations to ensure consistent production of quality mortgages and servicing those mortgages at levels that meet secondary mortgage market standards. We make significant investments in personnel and
technology to ensure the quality of our mortgage loan production. 
        We
estimate our liability for representations and warranties when we sell loans and update our estimate quarterly. Our provision for estimated losses arising from loan sales is recorded
as an adjustment to gain on sale of loans and securities. Following is a summary of the activity in our liability for representations and warranties for the periods presented:

 Portfolio Lending Activities  

        In our Banking Segment, our portfolio of loans held for investment generally includes mortgage loans originated or purchased for investment purposes and mortgage
loan warehouse lending advances. However, as a result of the market disruption in 2007, $18.8 billion in unpaid balance of non-conforming ARM and home equity loans held for sale
were transferred from the Mortgage Banking Segment's inventory of loans held for sale to the Banking Segment's portfolio for loans held for investment. These loans were transferred at the lower of
cost or estimated fair value, which resulted in a $547.2 million charge to gain on sale of loans and securities in our Mortgage Banking Segment. 
        In
our Mortgage Banking Segment, loans held for investment include mortgage loans repurchased due to breaches of representations and warranties; government-guaranteed or insured loans
repurchased from Ginnie Mae securitizations in place of continuing to advance delinquent principal and interest installments to security holders; and loans transferred from loans held for sale at the
lower of cost or estimated fair value.

        Our
primary credit risk management tool for our portfolio loans is the origination and purchase of loans underwritten to achieve high credit quality and collateral support. We assess a
loan's quality by
considering the borrower's credit profile and the value of collateral securing the loan. Where a proposed first mortgage loan's loan-to-value ratio is higher than a specified
level, which is usually 80% for conventional loans, we generally require the borrower to supplement the collateral with primary mortgage insurance. When we originate such loans without mortgage
insurance, we generally increase the interest rate as compared to a loan with mortgage insurance to compensate for the increased credit risk. 
        We
actively monitor our portfolio of loans held for investment and work with borrowers who contact us or who become delinquent on their loans in order to minimize credit losses. We use
several tools to establish communication with and assist borrowers in curing defaults on our loans, including frequent outreach efforts throughout the collection process using tools such as brochures,
housing fairs, counseling letters and DVD mailings. Our objective in the loss mitigation process is to develop payment plans or workout options that have both the highest probability of successful
resolution and minimal risk of loss to Countrywide. We have also developed loan modification programs designed to assist borrowers with refinancing their ARM and pay-option ARM loans
before their loans reset. 
        We
have taken steps in recent years to reduce the credit risk in our investment loan portfolio by acquiring supplemental mortgage insurance coverage. As of December 31, 2007,
$22.1 billion of Banking Operations' residential loan portfolio was covered by supplemental mortgage insurance purchased by the Bank on specified pools of loans, of which $15.0 billion
represents first loss coverage. The maximum loss coverage available under these policies on a combined basis is $1.5 billion. While these policies generally provide for first loss coverage,
some policies require premium adjustments if claims exceed specified levels. Furthermore, coverage limits vary by policy, with some policies having limits at the pool level, and others at the loan
level. The effect of this insurance on our estimate of credit losses is to reduce our provision for loan losses by $490.0 million through the recognition of a 
123



 

receivable
for pool mortgage insurance for the year ended December 31, 2007. Our estimate of the effect of mortgage insurance on the allowance for loan losses contemplates the effect of claim
disputes. 
        We
purchase credit enhancement from those mortgage insurance providers that have an AA- rating or equivalent from the credit rating agencies. This requirement is consistent
with the eligibility requirements of the government-sponsored enterprises for mortgage insurers. While the mortgage insurance industry has experienced recent adverse financial results with the
likelihood of further deterioration over the near term, we continue to monitor the respective capital positions of our mortgage insurance providers to assess their claims paying ability and have
concluded that this ability is not impaired. In the future, we will adjust our allowance for loan losses if we conclude that this capacity is impaired.

        A
commonly used measure of consumer creditworthiness is the borrower's ""FICO score,"" a measure developed by Fair Isaac Corporation and used by many lenders, including Countrywide, to
assess a prospective borrower's credit history and the effect of the prospect's current borrowing arrangements on their ability to repay a loan. Borrowers can be assigned a FICO score of between 300
(least creditworthy) and 850 (most creditworthy) based on their payment history, current indebtedness, length of credit history, recently-established credit and types of credit used.

        Banking
Operations holds a substantial investment in pay-option ARM and payment advantage ARM loans (together referred to as ""pay-option loans""). 


Pay-option
ARM loanshave interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually (subject to recast of the loan if
minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached). Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 71/2% maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are
adequate to repay a loan, the fully amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after either five or ten years and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not
subject to the 71/2% payment limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loans' balances.
Payment
advantage ARM loanshave interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject to recast of the loan if minimum
payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause the loan's principal balance to reach a certain maximum level within the first ten years of these loans, the
payment is reset to the interest-only payment; then at the 10-year point, the fully amortizing payment is required. 

        The
difference between the frequency of changes in the loans' interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments to 71/2% per
year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges. Unpaid interest charges are added to the loan balance until the loan's balance increases to a specified
limit, which is no more than 
125



 

115%
of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. 
        References
to pay-option loans in the following discussion include both pay-option and payment advantage loans. Assuming today's interest rates remain unchanged,
most borrowers who consistently make the minimum required payment will have the contractual right to make less than the full interest payment for three to five years from the date of funding, at which
time the loan balance limit will be reached and a new monthly payment amount will be required. Our borrowers' ability to defer portions of the interest accruing on their loans may expose us to
increased credit risk. This is because when the required monthly payments for these loans eventually increase, borrowers may be less able to pay the increased amounts and may be more likely to default
than a borrower with a loan whose initial payment provides for full amortization. Our exposure to this higher credit risk is increased by the amount of deferred interest that has been added to the
principal balance. 
        We
supplement our credit risk management practices relating to negatively amortizing ARM loans through a variety of methods, including active borrower communications both before and
after funding, through our underwriting standards and through the purchase of mortgage insurance. Our underwriting standards include a requirement that the borrower meet secondary market
debt-service ratio tests based on the borrower making the fully amortizing loan payment and assuming the loan's interest rate is fully indexed. (A fully indexed note rate equals the sum of
the current index rate plus the margin applicable to the loan.) However, most of the pay-option loans we hold were underwritten with stated or limited income documentation. We tightened
our underwriting standards during 2007 to reduce the availability of reduced documentation loans and loans on investor-owned properties, and have reduced the maximum
loan-to-value or combined loan-to-value ratio.

        The
Company routinely forecasts its exposure to payment recast on negatively amortizing loans. The following assumptions were used to forecast this exposure as of December 31,
2007: 


1)18%
Constant Prepayment Rate;
2)Use
of forward interest rate curves to estimate interest rates in future periods; and
3)Loans
that do not pay off completely are assumed to negatively amortize 100% of the time. 

        Using
these assumptions as of December 31, 2007, pay-option loans that are expected to reset are shown in the following table:

        The
increase in our nonperforming assets, the allowance for loan losses and charge-offs from the year-ago period was driven by the impact of a weakening housing
market and significant tightening of available credit on delinquency and default trends during the current year as well as portfolio seasoning. We expect the level of nonperforming assets and credit
losses to increase, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our loan portfolio as current weakness in the housing market develops and as our loan portfolio continues to season. 

 Mortgage Warehouse Lending Advances  

        We hold a portfolio of commercial loans made to other mortgage lenders to finance their inventories pending sale to Countrywide and other lenders. Our portfolio
of mortgage loan warehouse advances totaled $0.9 billion and the average loan balance was $8.3 million at December 31, 2007. These loans are underwritten by assessing the
creditworthiness of the warehouse lending borrowers. This includes reviewing both borrower-provided financial information and publicly available credit rating information and press coverage, as well
as understanding the borrowers' operational controls and product risk and assessments of collateral. 
        We
monitor the length of time that advances are outstanding against specific residential loans and may require the borrower to pay off aged advances. We also monitor the fair value of
our collateral to ensure that the level of collateral posted is adequate to repay our advance in the event of default by our borrower and we require our warehouse lending borrowers to post specified
levels of cash collateral to supplement the mortgage loan collateral. We also regularly review updated financial information of borrowers, including pipeline and hedging positions. We recorded
$1.6 million of charge-offs related to this activity during 2007 and no charge-offs in 2006 and 2005. During 2007, we adjusted our advance rates and limited the
collateral we advance funds against to that which we can sell into the presently disrupted secondary market in recognition of marketplace conditions. 

 Other Mortgage Loans Held for Investment  

        Our portfolio of other mortgage loans held for investment is in our Mortgage Banking Segment and includes loans we have repurchasedeither to remedy a
violation of a representation or warranty made in a loan sale, to minimize the cost of servicing a severely delinquent loan insured or partially guaranteed by the FHA or VA or in connection with a
clean-up call (a clean-up call represents the repurchase of mortgage loans when the remaining outstanding balance of the mortgage loans falls to a level where the cost of servicing the loans becomes

        As
discussed in the preceding sectionLending ActivitiesSale of
LoansRepresentations and Warrantieswe make provisions for losses that may arise from breaches of
representations and warranties when we record the sale of loans and we adjust our estimates for losses quarterly. We record repurchased loans at fair value when they are repurchased and any resulting
loss is charged against the liability. 
        We
may determine that a portion of the loans that we originate or purchase for sale will not be sold because of a defect, which may include a document deficiency, changes in secondary
market conditions or deterioration of the credit status of the loan while it was held for sale. Such loans are transferred to our portfolio of loans held for investment at the lower of cost or
estimated fair value on an individual loan basis and any loss is recorded as a component of gain on sale of loans or securities in current period earnings. As a result of the market disruption in
2007, we transferred $3.0 billion of mortgage loans to our Mortgage Banking Segment investment portfolio, which resulted in a $552.1 million charge to gain on sale of loans and
securities. Subsequent losses that may result from deteriorations in the
credit quality of the loans that have been transferred to the investment portfolio are included in our provision for loan losses.

(1)Excludes
$2,171.1 million and $1,254.9 million, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, of loans that we have the option (but not the obligation) to
repurchase and we have not exercised such option. These loans are required to be included in our balance sheet regardless of our intention to exercise the option to repurchase the loans.
(2)Excludes
government-guaranteed mortgage loans held for investment totaling $397.6 million and $334.5 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
(3)Generally
these loans have been repurchased and recorded at fair value or transferred to held for investment at lower of cost or estimated fair value. Fair values incorporate the
impaired status at 
131



 

the
date of repurchase of the loans. Losses related to subsequent deterioration in the credit quality of the loans are recorded in the allowance for loan losses. 


(4)Comprised
of warehouse lending advances secured by mortgage loans.
(5)The
allowance for loan losses excludes any reduction to the cost basis of loans recorded to reflect estimated fair value at repurchase or transfer to held for investment. 
        The
increase in the allowance for loan losses from December 31, 2006 is due to higher expectations of losses incurred in our portfolio driven by the impact of the weakening
housing market and significant tightening of available credit on delinquencies and default trends as well as portfolio seasoning.

        Charge-offs
increased due to increasing rates of default and loss severity, along with acceleration in the timing of charge-off recognition as a result of recent
trends in delinquency and foreclosures. 

 Mortgage Loans Held for Sale  

        At December 31, 2007, mortgage loans held for sale amounted to $11.7 billion. While loans are in inventory, we bear credit risk after taking into
consideration primary mortgage insurance (which is generally required for conventional first mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 80%), FHA insurance or VA
guarantees. 
        Loans
held for sale that have been placed on nonaccrual status include distressed loans that are generally purchased at a discount as part of the conduit activities of the Capital
Markets Segment and loans whose credit quality has deteriorated during the time that they have been held for sale. Nonaccrual loans totaled $206.7 million and $566.6 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value in the aggregate, which takes into account a reduction in value for
impaired loans. 

 Mortgage Reinsurance  

        We provide mortgage reinsurance on certain mortgage loans included in our servicing portfolio through contracts with several primary mortgage insurance companies.
Under these contracts, we provide aggregate excess loss coverage in a mezzanine layer in exchange for a portion of the pools' mortgage insurance premium. As of December 31, 2007, approximately
$121.7 billion of mortgage loans in our servicing portfolio are covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts. The reinsurance contracts place limits on our maximum exposure to losses. At
December 31, 2007, the maximum aggregate losses under the reinsurance contracts were limited to $1,070.2 million. We are required to pledge securities to cover this potential liability.
For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, we were not required to pay any losses under our reinsurance contracts. We reduced our liability for estimated reinsurance losses by
$7.4 million in 2007, and recorded provisions for losses of $35.8 million and $30.8 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The accumulated liability recorded for estimated
reinsurance totaled $148.8 million and $156.2 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 

 Securities Trading and Derivatives Counterparty Credit Risk  

        We have exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non-performance by our trading counterparties and counterparties to the
over-the-counter derivative financial instruments that we use in our interest rate risk management activities. We manage this credit risk by selecting only counterparties we
believe to be financially strong, spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single counterparty and by
entering into netting agreements with the counterparties, as appropriate. 
133




 





        The aggregate amount of counterparty credit exposure after consideration of relevant netting agreements, before and after collateral held by us, are as follows:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk     
        A significant market risk facing the Company is interest rate risk, which includes the risk that changes in interest rates will result in changes in the value of
our assets or liabilities (""price risk"") and the risk that net interest income from our mortgage loan and investment portfolios will change in response to changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk
includes both changes in ""risk-free"" rates (usually the U.S. Treasury rate for an asset of the same duration) and changes in the premiums to risk-free rates of return required
by investors. Such changes may be the result of liquidity and/or changing investor perceptions of risk. The overall objective of our interest rate risk management activities is to reduce the
variability of earnings caused by changes in interest rates. Our Corporate Asset/Liability Management Committee, which is comprised of several of the Company's senior financial executives, is
responsible for management of this risk. 
        We
manage interest rate risk with derivative financial instruments and by the structure of the Company's activities as follows: 


The
Company uses various financial instruments, including derivatives, to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to the values of its commitments to make or
purchase loans (also referred to as interest rate lock commitments or ""IRLCs""), mortgage loans held by the Company pending sale (""Mortgage Loan Inventory""), retained interests and trading securities,
as well as a portion of its debt.
Structurally,
the Company manages interest rate risk in its Mortgage Banking Segment through the natural counterbalance of its loan production and servicing businesses. In
its Banking Segment, the Company manages interest rate risk by funding the segment's interest-earning assets with liabilities of similar duration or a combination of derivative instruments and certain
liabilities that create repricing characteristics that closely reflect the repricing behaviors of those assets. 


 Interest Rate Lock Commitments and Mortgage Inventory  

        We are exposed to price risk relative to our Mortgage Loan Inventory and our IRLCs. The Mortgage Loan Inventory is comprised of mortgage loans held pending sale,
and is presently held for an average
of approximately 25 days. IRLCs guarantee the rate and points on the underlying mortgage or group of mortgages for a specified period, generally from seven to 75 days. 
        With
regard to loans held for sale, we are exposed to price risk from the time an IRLC is made to a mortgage applicant or financial intermediary to the time the resulting mortgage loan
is sold. For loans held for investment, we are exposed to price risk from the time an IRLC is made to a financial intermediary to the time the loan is purchased. During these periods, the Company is
exposed to losses 
134



 

if
mortgage rates rise or investor required yields increase, because the value of the IRLC or mortgage loan held for sale declines. To manage this price risk, the Company uses derivatives. 
        Managing
the interest rate risk related to IRLCs is complicated by the fact that the ultimate percentage of applications that close within the terms of the IRLC is beyond our control and
is driven primarily by changes in mortgage rates in the marketplace. In general, the percentage of applications that ultimately close within the terms of the IRLC increases if mortgage rates rise and
decreases if mortgage rates fall. This is due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicants' committed rates. The closing percentage is also influenced
by the source and age of the applications, purpose for the loans (purchase or refinance) and the application approval rate. We have developed closing ratio estimates using historical experience that
take into account all of these variables, as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage rates fall. Those closing ratios are used to estimate the aggregate
balance of loans that we expect to fund within the terms of the IRLCs. Our closing ratio estimates are revised periodically. 
        To
manage the price risk associated with IRLCs, we generally use a combination of net forward sales of MBS and put and call options on MBS, U.S. Treasury futures and Eurodollar futures.
We generally enter into forward sales contracts of MBS in an amount equal to the portion of the IRLCs expected to close, assuming no change in mortgage rates. We acquire put and call options to
protect against the variability of the rate of loan closings caused by changes in mortgage rates. To manage the credit spread component of price risk associated with our IRLCs, we may enter into
credit default swaps. 
        We
manage the price risk related to our Mortgage Loan Inventory primarily by entering into forward sales of MBS and Eurodollar futures contracts. The value of these forward MBS sales and
Eurodollar futures moves in the opposite direction of the value of the Mortgage Loan Inventory. To manage the credit spread component of price risk associated with our Mortgage Loan Inventory, we may
enter into credit default swaps. 
        We
manage the price risk related to our commercial mortgage loans using interest rate, total rate of return and credit default swaps. 
        We
actively manage the risk profiles of our IRLCs and Mortgage Loan Inventory on a daily basis. 
        A
more detailed description of the derivative instruments we use in our risk management activities related to the IRLCs and Mortgage Loan Inventory is presented below: 


Forward
Sales of MBS: An obligation to sell MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as mortgage rates rise.
Forward
Purchases of MBS: An obligation to buy MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as mortgage rates fall.
Call
Options on MBS: A right to buy MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as mortgage rates fall.
Put
Options on MBS: A right to sell MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as mortgage rates rise.
Call
Options on U.S. Treasury Futures: A right to acquire a U.S. Treasury futures contract at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as the
benchmark U.S. Treasury rate falls.
Put
Options on U.S. Treasury Futures: A right to sell a U.S. Treasury futures contract at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as the
benchmark U.S. Treasury rate rises. 

135



 




Short
Eurodollar Futures Contracts: The sale of a standardized exchange-traded contract that we do not own, the value of which is tied to spot Eurodollar rates at specified
future dates. The value increases when Eurodollar rates rise.
Credit
Default Swaps: An agreement to purchase credit event protection based on a financial index or security in exchange for paying a fixed fee or premium over the term of
the contract. For use in the risk management of commercial mortgage loans, the Company receives credit protection and pays a fixed fee or premium. The value of these contracts increases when the
probability of the occurrence of a credit event rises. 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) and Retained Interests  

        Our MSRs and retained interests are generally subject to loss in value when mortgage rates decline. Declining mortgage rates normally precipitate increased
mortgage refinancing activity to the extent that the borrower is able to obtain a new loan. Increased refinancing activity reduces the life of the loans underlying the MSRs and retained interests,
thereby reducing their value. Reductions in the value of these assets impact earnings primarily through change in fair value and impairment charges. To moderate the effect on earnings caused by a
rate-driven decline in fair value, we maintain a portfolio of financial instruments, including derivatives, which generally increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline (the
""Servicing Hedge""). 
        We
use the following financial instruments in our Servicing Hedge: 


Receiver
Swaptions: A right to enter a predetermined Interest Rate Swap at a future date where we receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate. These contracts increase
in value as rates fall.
Payor
Swaptions: A right to enter a predetermined Interest Rate Swap at a future date, where we pay the fixed rate and receive the floating rate. These contracts increase in
value as rates rise.
Interest
Rate Swaps: A mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments; one party paying a fixed rate and another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest
rate (e.g., U.S. Dollar LIBOR (""USD LIBOR"")). For use in the Servicing Hedge, we generally receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate. Such contracts increase in value as rates
fall.
U.S.
Treasury Futures: An agreement to purchase a U.S. Treasury security at a specified price in the future. The value increases as the benchmark U.S. Treasury rate falls.
Call
Options on U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures: A right to acquire a U.S. Treasury or Eurodollar futures contract at a specified price on a specified date in the
future. The value increases as the benchmark U.S. Treasury or Eurodollar rate falls.
Mortgage
Forward Rate Agreement: A mutual agreement to exchange a single cash flow at a forward settlement date, based on the basis point difference between the forward
fixed rate and floating rate set equal to the 30-day forward current coupon mortgage rate, known as the Constant Mortgage Maturity index, on the settlement date. For use in the Servicing
Hedge, we generally receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate. Such contracts increase in value as the spread between the current coupon mortgage rate and the swap curve tightens, or when
interest rates fall.
Forward
Sales of MBS: An obligation to sell MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as mortgage rates rise.
Forward
Purchases of MBS: An obligation to buy MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as mortgage rates fall. 

136



 




Put
Options on U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures: A right to sell a U.S. Treasury or Eurodollar futures contract at a specified price on a specified date in the future.
The value increases as the benchmark U.S. Treasury or Eurodollar rate rises. 


        These
instruments are combined to manage the overall risk profile of the MSRs and retained interests. We actively manage our MSR and retained interests risk profile on a daily basis. 

 Securities Trading Activities  

        Within our Capital Markets operations, we maintain a trading portfolio of fixed-income securities, primarily MBS. We are exposed to price changes in our trading
portfolio arising from interest rate changes during the period we hold the securities. To manage this risk, we use the following derivative instruments: 


Forward
Sales of To-Be-Announced (""TBA"") MBS: An obligation to sell agency pass-through MBS that have not yet been issued at a specified
price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as mortgage rates rise.
Forward
Purchases of TBA MBS: An obligation to purchase agency pass-through MBS that have not yet been issued at a specified price on a specified date in the
future. The value increases as mortgage rates fall.
Interest
Rate Swaps: A mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments; one party paying a fixed rate and another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest
rate (e.g. USD LIBOR). For use in its trading portfolio risk management activities, the Company typically receives the floating rate and pays the fixed rate. Such contracts increase in value as
rates rise.
Futures
Contract: A standardized exchange-traded contract, the value of which is tied to the spot Federal Funds or Eurodollar rates at specified future dates. The value of
these contracts increases when Federal Funds or Eurodollar rates fall.
Total
rate of return swaps: An agreement to pay or receive the total return on a financial index or security in exchange for the payment or receipt of a floating rate of
interest over the term of the contract. For use in the risk management of the commercial mortgage portfolio, the Company pays the return on a published CMBS index and receives the floating rate of
interest. The value of these contracts increases as the value of the index declines.
Put
Options on Federal Funds and Eurodollar futures Contract: A right to sell a Federal Funds or Eurodollar futures contract at a specified price on a specified date in the
future. The value increases as the Federal Funds or Eurodollar rates rise.
Call
Options on Federal Funds and Eurodollar futures Contract: A right to acquire a Federal Funds or Eurodollar futures contract at a specified price on a specified date in
the future. The value increases as the Federal Funds or Eurodollar rate falls.
Short
Futures Contract: A sale of a standardized exchange-traded contract that we do not own, the value of which is tied to spot Federal Funds or Eurodollar rates at
specified future dates. The value of these contracts increases when Federal Funds or Eurodollar rates rise.
Interest
Rate Cap: A right to receive cash if a reference interest rate rises above a contractual strike rate. The reference interest rates used in the Company's interest
rate caps include mortgage rates, U.S. Treasury rates, and USD LIBOR. The value increases as the reference rate rises.
Payer
Swaption: A right to enter a predetermined Interest Rate Swap at a future date where we receive the floating rate and pay the fixed rate. These contracts increase in
value as rates rise.

Swaptions: A right to enter a predetermined Interest Rate Swap at a future date where we receive the fixed rate and pay the floating rate. These contracts increase
in value as rates fall.
Forward
rate agreement: A mutual agreement to exchange a single cash flow at a forward settlement date, based on the difference between the forward fixed rate and floating
rate set equal to the 30-day forward current coupon rate. For use in the risk management of the
broker-dealer securities trading portfolio, the Company receives the floating rate and pays the fixed. Such contracts increase in value as rates rise. 
 Long-term Debt and Deposit Liabilities  

        Management's objective in financing the activities of the Company is to ensure access to reliable and cost-effective funding from a variety of sources
in order to meet the Company's financing requirements under various market conditions. These financing activities subject the Company to interest rate risk. Specifically, the Company is exposed to the
risk that the interest expense it incurs on its long-term borrowings will change at a different speed than the income it earns on the assets financed by the long-term debt,
contributing to variability of net interest income earnings. To address this risk, management seeks long-term debt structured to reprice in a manner similar to the assets it is financing.
However, the Company may not be able to obtain access to borrowings structured to match the repricing characteristics of the assets being financed at optimal interest rates (i.e., cost).
Management addresses this constraint, in part, by entering into interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements designed to modify the structure of its borrowings. These agreements have the effect
of changing the structure of a debt agreement to one that approximates the repricing characteristics of the assets financed. 
Impact of Changes in Interest Rates on the Net Value of the Company's Interest Rate-Sensitive Financial Instruments  
        We perform various sensitivity analyses that quantify the net financial impact of changes in interest rates on our interest rate-sensitive assets,
liabilities and commitments. These analyses incorporate assumed changes in the interest rate environment, including selected hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve. 
        We
employ various commonly used modeling techniques to value our financial instruments in connection with these sensitivity analyses. For mortgage loans, MBS, MBS forward contracts,
collateralized mortgage obligations, interest-only securities and MSRs, we use option-adjusted spread models. The primary assumptions used in these models for the purpose of these
sensitivity analyses are the prepayment speeds, risk-adjusted return requirements and implied market volatility of interest rates. For options and interest rate floors, we use an
option-pricing model. The primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates. For retained interests, with the exception of interest-only securities, we
use a zero volatility discounted cash flow model. The primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment rates, discount rates and credit losses.

        These
sensitivity analyses are limited in that they were performed at a particular point in time; are based on the hedge position in place at that particular point in time; only
contemplate certain movements in interest rates; do not incorporate changes in interest rate volatility or changes in the relationship of one interest rate index to another; are subject to the
accuracy of various assumptions used, including prepayment forecasts and discount rates; and do not incorporate other factors that would impact the Company's overall financial performance in such
scenarios, most significantly the impact of changes in loan production earnings that result from changes in interest rates. Not all of the changes in fair value would affect current period earnings.
For example, changes in fair value of securities accounted for as available-for-sale are recognized as a component of shareholders' equity, net of income taxes, and our debt is
carried at its unpaid balances net of issuance discount or premium. Absent hedge accounting, changes in the market value of our debt are not recorded in current-period earnings. For these reasons, the
preceding estimates should not be viewed as an earnings forecast. 

 Market RiskForeign Currency Risk  

        To diversify our funding sources on a global basis, we issue a portion of our medium-term notes denominated in foreign currencies. We manage the
associated
foreign currency risk through cross-currency swap transactions. The terms of the cross-currency swaps have the effect of converting all foreign currency-denominated medium-term notes into
U.S. dollar-denominated obligations, thereby eliminating the associated foreign currency risk. As a result, potential changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies denominating such
medium-term notes are not expected to have a financial impact on future earnings, fair values or cash flows. 
Operational Risk  
        All businesses face operational risk, which is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. We
categorize operational risk into the areas of human resources, vendor management, custody of assets, accounting and financial disclosure, technology, physical security, natural hazard and environment,
fraud and embezzlement (internal and external), political and governmental affairs, modeling, compliance, regulatory and governance. We have documented our operational risks and corresponding
controls. This information is utilized by executive officers and appropriate governance groups within the Company for ongoing risk assessment, monitoring, testing and review. Responsibility for
operational risk identification and management is assigned to each of our business units with centralized corporate oversight and support. Operational risk management is embedded into our daily
activities. Examples include: 


Identification
of operational risk is performed at the activity level. Key controls that address the risks are identified and monitored by management. Operational controls
that affect financial reporting are also tested by business unit management
Independent
testing and evaluation of internal controls is conducted by our internal audit function 

140



 




Review
of operational risks (including the sufficiency of governance structures to mitigate those risks) is conducted by an independent enterprise risk assessment function
Staff
is dedicated to specific areas of key operational risk mitigation, such as a disaster recovery, central compliance oversight and fraud risk management
Oversight
of operational risk on an enterprise-wide basis is conducted by Countrywide's Operational Risk Committee comprised of senior executives; a risk
managers' roundtable comprised of divisional operation risk managers; and on a divisional basis, by business unit risk committees comprised of the business unit's leaders and risk managers
The
processes supporting our key business activities are evaluated and redesigned as needed in a structured manner that minimizes errors and improves efficiency
A
corporate expectation of ethical behavior is set with a formalized code of ethics, mandatory annual compliance training, provision for anonymous reporting of suspected
breaches of corporate ethics and independent monitoring by and reporting of alleged breaches of corporate ethics to the Audit and Ethics Committee of the Board of Directors.

(1)Expressed
as a percentage of the total number of loans serviced, excluding subserviced loans and loans purchased at a discount due to their collection status. 
        We
attribute the overall increase in delinquencies in our servicing portfolio from December 31, 2006 to December 31, 2007, to increased production of loans in recent years
with higher
loan-to-value ratios and reduced documentation requirements, combined with a weakening housing market and significant tightening of available credit and to portfolio seasoning.
Changing borrower profiles and trends toward higher initial combined loan-to-value ratios make this impact most significant on nonprime delinquency. We believe the delinquency
rates in our servicing portfolio are consistent with rates for similar mortgage loan portfolios in the industry. 
 
 
Inflation     
        Our operations that would be most significantly impacted by an increase in inflation are our Mortgage Banking and Capital Markets Segments. Interest rates
normally increase during periods of rising inflation. Historically, as interest rates increase, mortgage loan production decreases. An environment of gradual interest rate increases may, however,
signify an improving economy or increasing real estate values, which in turn may stimulate increased home buying activity. Generally, in periods of reduced mortgage loan production, the associated
profit margins also decline due to increased competition among mortgage loan originators and to higher unit costs, thus further reducing 
142



 

our
loan production earnings. However, in a rising interest rate environment, our loan servicing earnings generally increase because mortgage prepayment rates tend to slow down, thereby extending the
average life of our servicing portfolio and related MSRs. Within our broker-dealer operations, rising interest rates generally lead to a reduction in trading and underwriting activities in our primary
niche, the mortgage securities market. 
 
 
Seasonality     
        The mortgage banking industry is generally subject to seasonal trends, reflecting the pattern in the national housing market. Home sales typically rise during the
spring and summer seasons and decline during the fall and winter seasons. Seasonality has less of an effect on mortgage refinancing activity, which is primarily driven by prevailing mortgage rates. In
addition, mortgage delinquency rates typically rise temporarily in the winter months, driven by mortgagor payment patterns. 
 
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations     

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Guarantees  

        In the ordinary course of our business we engage in financial transactions that are not reflected on our balance sheet. (See
Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the financial statement section of this Report for a description of our
consolidation policy.) Such transactions are structured to manage our interest rate, credit or liquidity risks, to diversify funding sources or to optimize our capital. 
        Most
of our off-balance sheet arrangements relate to the securitization of mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan securitizations are normally structured as sales in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities (""SFAS 140""), and involve the transfer of mortgage loans to qualifying special-purpose entities that are not subject to consolidation. In a securitization,
an entity transferring the assets is able to sell those assets for cash. Special-purpose entities used in such securitizations obtain cash by issuing securities representing beneficial interests in
the transferred assets to investors. In a securitization, we customarily provide representations and warranties with respect to, and we generally retain the right to service, the transferred mortgage
loans. 
        We
also generally have the right to repurchase mortgage loans from the special-purpose entity pursuant to a clean-up call, which is exercised when the costs exceed the
benefits of servicing the remaining loans. 
        Our
Prime Mortgage Loans generally are securitized on a non-recourse basis, while Prime Home Equity and Nonprime Loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for
credit losses. During 2007, we securitized $24.0 billion in Nonprime Mortgage and Prime Home Equity Loans with limited recourse for credit losses. Our exposure to credit losses related to our
limited recourse securitization activities is limited to the carrying value of our subordinated interests, to losses that may arise from rapid amortization events that cause subsequent draws that we
are contractually required to advance to be subordinated to all other interests in these securitizations and to the contractual limit of reimbursable losses under our corporate guarantees less the
recorded liability for such guarantees. 
        During
2007, our off-balance sheet obligations relating to rapid amortization events contained in our home equity line-of-credit securitizations were triggered as a result of
actual and anticipated loan losses relating to loans underlying these securitizations exceeding specified thresholds or durations. Normally, a rapid amortization event is not expected to occur and is
deemed remote. However, sudden deterioration in the housing market experienced in late 2007 resulted in it becoming probable that a rapid amortization event would occur. Because of these events, we
recorded impairment losses of $704.1 million related to estimated future draw obligations on the home equity securitizations that have 
143



 

entered
or are expected to enter rapid amortization status. The available credit lines for the securitizations subject to or expected to be subject to a future draw obligation are approximately
$2.4 billion at December 31, 2007. However, due to the borrower's ability to pay down and redraw balances, a maximum obligation cannot be defined. 
        For
a further discussion of our exposure to credit risk, see the section in this Report entitled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of OperationsCredit Risk Management. 
        We
do not believe there are any other off-balance sheet arrangements that have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
        The
sales proceeds and cash flows from our securitizations for 2007 and additional information with respect to securitization activities are included in the financial statements section
of this Report Financial StatementsNote 3Loan Sales.

respective notes to the financial statements included in this Report. 

        As
of December 31, 2007, the Company had undisbursed home equity lines of credit and construction loan commitments of $9.1 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively. As
of December 31, 2007, outstanding commitments to fund mortgage loans totaled $23.9 billion. 
        In
connection with our underwriting activities, at December 31, 2007 we had commitments to purchase and sell new issues of securities aggregating $1.1 billion and
$1.2 billion, respectively. 
 
 
Prospective Trends     

 Outlook  

        We believe the current environment will provide significant continuing challenges for the financial services sector, including Countrywide. Specifically, in the
near term, we have experienced and are likely to continue to experience: 


Continued
pressure on housing values and mortgage origination volumes
Increasing
delinquencies and foreclosures
Continued
disruptions in the secondary mortgage and debt capital markets and
More
restrictive legislative and regulatory environments. 

144



 




        As
a result of these conditions, we are experiencing, among other things, the following: 


Higher
credit losses on delinquent loans and subordinated interests
Reduced
access to secondary mortgage and debt capital markets
Increased
cost of debt
Lower
loan production volumes and
Lower
margins on loans produced. 

        In
response to the current environment, Countrywide has made changes to tighten the underwriting guidelines for loan products offered and has adjusted loan pricing to reflect market
conditions. The tightening of underwriting guidelines included reductions in the availability of reduced documentation loans and loans on investor-owned properties and in the maximum
loan-to-value or combined loan-to-value ratio. The impact of these changes was most significant to Nonprime Mortgage, Prime Home Equity and
non-conforming prime loans. Further reductions in the Company's funding volume could result. Additionally, during 2007, we transferred $21.8 billion of Nonprime Mortgage, Prime Home
Equity and non-conforming loans, after giving effect to a $1.1 billion write-down, from our inventory of mortgage loans held for sale to our portfolio of loans held for
investment. We expect to retain more loans in our portfolio of loans held for investment or to hold additional loan or security inventory until market conditions improve. We have also increased our
loss mitigation efforts through proactive outreach to borrowers, partnering with non-profit home ownership counseling groups and increasing our staff dedicated to working with our
borrowers to prevent or cure loan defaults. In an effort to ensure the adequacy of our funding liquidity, we continue to transition to more reliable funding sources, which may be more costly.
We are also optimizing our organizational structure through, among other things, the integration of Countrywide Bank and Countrywide Home Loans. 
        As
a result of these conditions we expect our earnings and returns through 2008 to be below our long-term target levels. 
        Our
outlook is subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the section, Risk FactorsForward-Looking Financial StatementsFactors
That May Affect Our Future Results. 

 Merger with Bank of America Corporation  

        As more fully detailed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 17, 2008, and the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 of Bank of America filed on February 12, 2008, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Bank of America. The Merger Agreement provides for
Countrywide to merge with and into a wholly-owned merger subsidiary of Bank of America (""Merger Sub""), with Merger Sub continuing as the surviving company. 
        The
terms of the Merger Agreement provide for the conversion of each share of Countrywide common stock into 0.1822 of a share of Bank of America common stock. Consummation of the Merger,
which is currently anticipated to occur in the third quarter of 2008, is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, Countrywide stockholder and regulatory approvals. 
        The
Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for Countrywide and Bank of America, as the case may be, applicable upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Merger
Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that, in the event of the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Countrywide may be required to pay Bank of America a termination
fee equal to $160 million.

 United States Mortgage Market  

        The U.S. housing market is undergoing a significant contraction and lenders and investors are tightening their credit standards. Therefore, mortgage origination
volumes are likely to continue decreasing and growth in total mortgage indebtedness is likely to slow in the short term. 
        Over
time, the level of complexity in the mortgage lending business has increased significantly due to several factors: 


The
continuing evolution of the secondary mortgage market and demand by borrowers have resulted in a proliferation of mortgage products
Greater
regulation imposed on the industry has resulted in increased costs and the need for higher levels of specialization
Interest
rate volatility has increased in recent years. At the same time, homeowners' propensity to refinance their mortgages has increased as the refinance process has
become more efficient and cost effective. The combined result has been large swings in the volume of mortgage loans originated from year to year. These volume swings have placed significant
operational and financial pressures on mortgage lenders. 

        To
compete effectively in this environment, mortgage lenders must have a very high level of operational, technological and managerial expertise. In addition, the residential mortgage
business has become more capital-intensive and therefore access to capital at a competitive cost is critical. As a result of reduced access to capital, general housing trends, rising delinquencies and
defaults and other factors, many mortgage lenders have recently experienced severe financial difficulty, with many exiting the business or filing for bankruptcy protection. Primarily because of these
factors, the industry continues its consolidation trend. 
        Today,
large and sophisticated financial institutions dominate the residential mortgage industry. These industry leaders are primarily commercial banks operating through their mortgage
banking subsidiaries. According to the trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance, the top five originators produced 53% of
all loans originated during 2007, up from 47% five years ago. (Reprinted with the permission of IMF Copyrighted. All rights reserved by IMF.) 
        The
loan volume for the top five originators, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, is as follows (Reprinted with the permission of IMF

        We
believe the consolidation trend in the mortgage industry will continue, as the aforementioned market forces will continue to drive out weak competitors. 
        Compared
to Countrywide, the other industry leaders are less reliant on the secondary mortgage market as an outlet for mortgages, due to their greater portfolio lending capacity. This
has placed us at a competitive disadvantage in the current disruption of the secondary mortgage market, which has removed a competitive outlet for our loans. We responded by shifting our production
and related financing to our Bank and by focusing on agency-eligible loan production. 
        This
consolidation trend has naturally carried over to the loan servicing side of the mortgage business. Today, the top five mortgage servicers combined have a 46% share of the total
mortgages outstanding, up from 38% five years ago. Following is a year-over-year comparison of loan volume for the top five servicers, according to  Inside Mortgage Finance (Reprinted with the permission

 Housing Values  

        Housing values affect us in several ways. Declines in housing values affect us by negatively impacting the demand for mortgage financing, increasing risk of
default by mortgagors and increasing risk of loss on defaulted loans. These factors are somewhat offset by reduced prepayments in our loan servicing portfolio. Conversely, rising housing values point
to healthy demand for purchase-money mortgage financing and increased average loan balances and a reduction in the risk of loss on sale of foreclosed real estate in the event a loan defaults. However,
as housing values appreciate, prepayments of existing mortgages tend to increase as borrowers look to monetize the additional equity in their homes. 
        Recently,
we have seen broad-based declines in housing values. We expect housing values to continue to decrease during the near term which will affect our credit loss experience and has
affected our willingness to offer certain mortgage loan products, both of which have and will continue to impact our earnings, particularly in the short term. 

 Secondary Mortgage Market Investor Demand  

        Changes in investor demand for mortgage loans can have a significant impact on our ability to access the secondary mortgage market as a competitive outlet. In
2007, we saw an increase in investor required yields, first for nonprime loans or securities followed by Prime Home Equity Loans and then non-conforming loans, together with a lessening in
the liquidity for such loans and securities caused by reduced investor demand. In the second half of 2007 the secondary mortgage market for non agency-eligible loans became largely illiquid and
certain credit rating agencies have downgraded their securitization ratings of large numbers of mortgage-backed securities. These factors have combined to severely decrease demand for and
profitability of a large portion of the products we have historically produced. In response to these developments we have tightened our underwriting and program 
147



 
guidelines,
significantly limiting our production of non agency-eligible loans. These changes have impacted our gain on sale margin and we expect these impacts to continue in the short term. 

 Impact of Declines in Credit Performance  

        With the current contraction in the U.S. housing market and the resulting declining housing prices, along with worsening economic conditions, we expect elevated
credit losses in the near term. In 2007, we have observed a marked decline in credit performance (as adjusted for age) for recent vintages, especially those loans with higher risk characteristics,
including reduced documentation, higher loan-to-value ratios or low credit scores. Deterioration in the credit performance of these loans has resulted in increased credit
losses and impairment of our related credit-subordinated interests, recognition of accelerated amortization events, higher claims under our representations and warranties and reduced demand for our
mortgage-backed securities and the availability of credit enhancements for the loans and securities we sell and invest in. We expect these factors to continue and for future earnings to be impacted. 

 Funding Liquidity  

        We have contingency planning protocols for funding liquidity that were designed to encompass a wide variety of market conditions. We place major emphasis on the
adequacy, reliability and diversity of our funding sources. 
        Starting
in the second quarter, funding liquidity in the financial services sector was constrained primarily due to changes in secondary mortgage market investor demand. During the third
quarter, this condition worsened and expanded to include the debt markets we have traditionally relied upon to meet our short-term funding needs. 
        As
discussed in the section Liquidity and Capital Resources, we have adjusted our operations and financing sources to address the current
market conditions, including accessing other pre-existing funding liquidity sources, procuring new sources and accelerating the integration of our mortgage company with the Bank. The Bank
has significant liquidity sources available to fund our mortgage banking operations. While we believe we currently have adequate funding liquidity, the effect of future developments on the Company may
require us to make additional operational adjustments and/or procure additional sources of financing. 

 Regulatory Trends  

        The regulatory environments in which we operate have an impact on the activities in which we may engage, how the activities may be carried out and the
profitability of those activities. Therefore, changes to laws, regulations or regulatory policies can affect whether and to what extent we are able to operate profitably. 
        Proposed
local, state and federal legislation and regulations targeted at predatory lending could have the unintended consequence of raising the cost or otherwise reducing the
availability of mortgage credit for those potential borrowers with less than prime-quality credit histories. Over the longer term, such legislation and regulations will influence the terms and
underwriting of products that will be offered to nonprime loan applicants and are therefore likely to limit any future growth of our nonprime lending. Additionally, there may be future local, state
and federal legislation that restricts our ability to communicate with and solicit business from current and prospective customers in such a way that we are not able to originate new loans or sell
other products at current profit margins. 
        On
February 13, 2008, the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 was signed into law. The law provides for, among other things, temporary increases in the loan limits for the FHA's
Single-Family Program and the conforming loan limits for loans eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The 
148



 

limits
are raised to as high as $729,750 from the current $362,790 for the FHA Single Family program and $417,000 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The temporary increase applies to loans originated
between July 1, 2007 and December 31, 2008. 
        Implementation
of the law will require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to develop the internal systems necessary to handle regional loan limits and develop underwriting, pricing and
securitization standards for these loans and obtain regulatory approval from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprises Oversight. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprises Oversight has estimated that
its approval process could take from one to three months. The effect of the law on our loan production has not yet been determined and will depend, in part, on the regional loan limits and related
loan underwriting guidelines and pricing. 
        For
a further discussion of proposed federal and state laws and regulations, see RegulationsProposed Federal and State Laws and Regulations  in the preceding Part I, Item 1Business.

        At
December 31, 2007, we estimated the mortgage origination market for 2008 to be $1.7 trillion based on prevailing interest rates at that time. Our estimates of the mortgage
market changes as interest rates change and our current estimate for 2008 is $1.8 trillion. The forecasted reduction from 2007 is attributable to an expected decline in both purchase and refinance
activity. We have begun and are continuing to right-size our loan production operations in anticipation of the continuing near-term softness in the origination market. This
mortgage market forecast would imply declining pressure on our loan servicing business due to a reduction in mortgage loan prepayment activity. In our Capital Markets Segment business, such a drop in
mortgage originations would likely result in a reduction in mortgage securities trading and underwriting volume and our conduit activities, which would have a negative impact on profitability. 

 Accounting Developments  

        In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements, (""SFAS 157""). SFAS 157 provides a framework for measuring fair value when such measurements are used for accounting purposes. The framework focuses
on an exit price in the principal (or, alternatively, the most advantageous) market accessible in an orderly transaction between willing market participants. SFAS 157 establishes a three-tiered
fair value hierarchy with Level 1 representing quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market and Level 3 representing estimated values based on unobservable
inputs. Under SFAS 157, related disclosures are segregated for assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on the level used within the hierarchy to determine their fair values. The
Company adopted SFAS 157 on its effective date of January 1, 2008, and the financial impact upon adoption was not material. 
149



 
        In
February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, (""SFAS 159""). SFAS 159 permits fair value accounting to be irrevocably elected for certain
financial assets and liabilities on an individual contract basis at the time of acquisition or at a remeasurement event date. Upon adoption of SFAS 159, fair value accounting may also be
elected for existing financial assets and liabilities. For those instruments for which fair value accounting is elected, changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings and fees and costs
associated with origination or acquisition will be recognized as incurred rather than deferred. SFAS 159 is effective January 1, 2008, with early adoption permitted as of
January 1, 2007. The Company adopted SFAS 159 concurrent with the adoption of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008 and the financial impact upon adoption was not material. 
        In
April 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39, (""FSP
FIN 39-1""). FSP FIN 39-1 amends certain paragraphs of FASB Interpretation Number 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
Contracts,an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 10 and FASB Statement No. 105 (""FIN 39"") to permit a reporting entity to offset fair value
amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same
counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. FSP FIN 39-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, with early application permitted. Upon
application, the Company shall be permitted to change its accounting policy to offset or not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. The
Company adopted FSP FIN 39-1 on its effective date of January 1, 2008 and the financial impact upon adoption was not material. 
        In
November 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109 (""SAB 109""). SAB 109 supersedes Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 105 (""SAB 105""), Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments. It clarifies that the expected net future cash flows
related to the associated servicing of a loan should be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. However, it retains the
guidance in SAB 105 that internally-developed intangible assets should not be recorded as part of the fair value of a derivative loan commitment. The guidance is effective on a prospective
basis to derivative loan commitments issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning after December 15, 2007. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159, this
guidance generally would result in higher fair values being recorded upon initial recognition of derivative loan commitments. 
        In
December of 2007, The American Securitization Forum (""ASF"") issued the Streamlined Foreclosure and Loss Avoidance Framework for Securitized Adjustable Rate
Mortgage Loans (the ""ASF Framework""). The ASF Framework was developed to address large numbers of subprime loans that are at risk of default when the loans reset from their
initial fixed interest rates to variable rates during the coming 18 months. The objective of the framework is to provide uniform guidelines for evaluating large numbers of loans for refinancing
in an efficient manner while complying with the relevant tax regulations and off-balance sheet accounting standards for loan securitizations. The ASF Framework was developed with the participation of
representatives of the mortgage securitization industry and the U.S. Government to provide streamlined borrower evaluation procedures in the evaluation of loan modification options for borrowers with
subprime adjustable-rate loans meeting certain criteria. Specifically, the ASF Framework targets loans: 


originated
between January 1, 2005 and July 31, 2007
with
initial fixed interest rate periods of 36 months or less and
that
are scheduled for their first interest rate reset between January 1, 2008 and July 31, 2010. 

150



 




        The
ASF Framework requires the loan servicer to categorize the targeted loans into one of three segments and address the borrowers according to the assigned segment: 


Segment
1 loans: the borrower is likely to be able to refinance into any available mortgage productthe borrowers should refinance their loans into the available
products if they are unwilling or unable to meet the reset payment
Segment
2 loans: the loan is current but the borrower is unlikely to be able to refinance into any readily available mortgage industry productthese borrowers
should be evaluated for streamlined (or ""fast track"") evaluation and modification
Segment
3 loans: the loan is not currentthe servicer should determine the appropriate loss mitigation strategyother than a streamlined
modificationthat maximizes the recoveries to the securitization trust that holds the loan. Loss mitigation strategies may include loan modification, forbearance, short sale or
foreclosure. 

        The
ASF Framework specifies criteria that borrowers who are evaluated for streamlined modification must meet to qualify for a fast track modification, including property occupancy,
credit score and an expected payment change threshold when the interest rate resets. Segment 2 borrowers who meet the specified criteria are identified for ""fast track"" loan modifications. 
        On
January 8, 2008, the SEC's Office of the Chief Accountant issued a letter addressing the accounting issues relating to the ASF Framework. The letter concluded that the SEC
would not object to continuing off-balance sheet accounting treatment for Segment 2 loans modified pursuant to the ASF Framework. The SEC's Office of the Chief Accountant also asked the FASB to
address the issues related to the sales accounting guidance in the applicable accounting literature. 
        We
are evaluating the ASF Framework but have not yet modified a significant volume of loans using the ASF Framework. At December 31, 2007, we serviced subprime ARM loans
originated between January 1, 2005 through July 31, 2007 totaling $21.1 billion that were included in securitization transactions with unpaid balances totaling
$31.4 billion. Our recorded investment in retained interests relating to these loans totaled $239.2 million at December 31, 2007. 
        For
those current loans that are accounted for off-balance sheet that are modified, but not as part of the ASF Framework above, the servicer must perform on an individual basis,
an analysis of the borrower and the loan to demonstrate it is probable that the borrower will not meet the repayment obligation in the near term. Such analysis shall provide sufficient evidence to
demonstrate that the loan is in imminent or reasonably foreseeable default. The SEC's Office of the Chief Accountant issued a letter in July 2007 stating that it would not object to continuing
off-balance sheet accounting treatment for these loans.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures  


(1)Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

        Our management has conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act"")),
as of the end of the period covered by this Report as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Report. 


(2)Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

        Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. 
        The
Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. 
        In
making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria established in ""Internal ControlIntegrated Framework"" issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of
December 31, 2007. 
        KPMG LLP,
the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company's financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
period ended December 31, 2007, has issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board. This report appears on the following page. 
        In
addition, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2007 that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Countrywide Financial Corporation: 
        We
have audited Countrywide Financial Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in  Internal ControlIntegrated Framework
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying management report. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. 
        We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 
        Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
        In
our opinion, the Company maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in  Internal ControlIntegrated
Framework issued by COSO. 
        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Countrywide Financial
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and comprehensive (loss) income, and cash
flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2007, and our report dated February 28, 2008, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     
The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Countrywide Financial Corporation:  
        We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Countrywide Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders' equity and comprehensive (loss) income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2007. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also audited financial statement schedules I and II. These consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
statement schedules based on our audits. 
        We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
        In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Countrywide Financial Corporation and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31,
2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. 
        We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial
reporting. 
        As
discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation 48, Accounting for
Uncertainty in Income Taxes. As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123R, Share-Based Payment (as amended) and the provisions of SFAS No. 156,  Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment of SFAS No. 140. As discussed in note 20 to the consolidated financial
statements, effective December 31, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans.

 COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
Note 1Organization  
        Countrywide Financial Corporation (""Countrywide"") is a holding company which, through its subsidiaries (collectively, the ""Company""), is engaged in mortgage
lending and other real estate finance-related businesses, including mortgage banking, banking and mortgage warehouse lending, dealing in securities and insurance underwriting. 
        As
more fully detailed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 17, 2008, and the Registration Statement on
Form S-4 of Bank of America Corporation (""Bank of America"") filed on February 12, 2008, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") with Bank of
America. The Merger Agreement provides for Countrywide to merge (the ""Merger"") with and into a wholly-owned merger subsidiary of Bank of America (""Merger Sub""), with Merger Sub continuing as the
surviving company. 
        The
terms of the Merger Agreement provide for the conversion of each share of Countrywide common stock into 0.1822 of a share of Bank of America common stock. Consummation of the Merger,
which is currently anticipated to occur in the third quarter of 2008, is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, Countrywide stockholder and regulatory approvals. 
        The
Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for Countrywide and Bank of America, as the case may be, applicable upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Merger
Agreement. The Merger Agreement provides that, in the event of the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, Countrywide may be required to pay Bank of America a termination
fee equal to $160 million. 
        The
Merger Agreement provides for both Countrywide and Bank of America to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course until the Merger is completed and not to take certain
actions during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the date of completion of the Merger. 
Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
        A summary of the Company's significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements follows. 

 Use of Estimates  

        Management is required to make estimates and assumptions to prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(""GAAP""). Management's estimates and assumptions materially affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements,
and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

 Principles of Consolidation  

        The Company comprises both operating and special purpose entities (""SPEs""). With respect to operating entities, the consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Countrywide Financial
Corporation, all majority-owned subsidiaries and all joint ventures for which it has operational control. The Company has whole or majority ownership of all of its subsidiaries, and has control of its
joint ventures. Therefore, Countrywide has no significant equity method or cost-basis investments. 
F-8



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
        SPEs
are evaluated first for classification as ""qualifying special purpose entities"" (""QSPEs"") as specified by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140,  Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities, (""SFAS 140""). SPEs that are classified as QSPEs
are excluded from the consolidated financial statements of the Company. SPEs that are not classified as QSPEs are further evaluated for classification as variable interest entities as specified by
FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. Special purpose entities that meet the definition of variable
interest entities where the Company is identified as the primary beneficiary of the entity are included in Countrywide's consolidated financial statements. 
        All
material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Minority interests in the Company's majority-owned subsidiaries are included in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and minority interests in the Company's earnings are charged to other operating expenses, net of applicable income taxes, in the Company's
consolidated statements of operations. 

 Financial Statement Reclassifications  

        Certain amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, have been reclassified to conform to the
presentation for the year ended December 31, 2007. 

 Derivative Financial Instruments  

        The Company uses derivative financial instruments extensively as part of its interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities. (See
Note 4Derivative Financial Instruments, for further discussion about the Company's risk management activities.) All derivative
financial instruments are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. 
        The
Company designates each derivative instrument it has entered into as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability, or of an unrecognized firm commitment (""fair
value"" hedge); a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (""cash flow"" hedge); or as a
free-standing derivative instrument. 
        For
a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recorded
in current period earnings. 
        For
a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity, to the extent that the derivative
is an effective hedge, and are subsequently reclassified to earnings in the same period(s) that the hedged transaction impacts net earnings, and on the same statement of operations line item as the
hedged item. The ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge is reported in current period earnings on the same statement of operations line item as the hedged item. 
        For
free-standing derivative instruments, changes in the fair values are reported in current period earnings. 
        At
the inception of a hedge, the Company formally documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objective and strategy for
undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivative instruments that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. The Company also formally assesses, both at the inception of 
F-9



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 

the
hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments used are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. If it is determined that the
derivative instrument is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. 
        The
Company also discontinues hedge accounting when (1) a derivative instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised; or (2) a derivative instrument is
de-designated as a hedge instrument because it is unlikely a forecasted transaction will occur; or (3) the Company determines that the designation of a derivative instrument as a
hedge is no longer appropriate. When hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative instrument continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair value recognized in
current period earnings. However, the carrying value of the previously hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value. 
        When
hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the derivative instrument continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its
fair value, and gains and losses that were accumulated in other accumulated comprehensive income are recognized in current period earnings. When hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedging
instrument is sold or terminated, the amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income to the date of sale or termination, if any, is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income until
the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. 
        The
Company occasionally purchases or originates financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative instrument. At inception, the Company assesses whether the economic
characteristics of the embedded derivative instrument are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the financial instrument (host contract), whether the financial instrument that
embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is currently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and whether a separate instrument with the
same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative instrument. 
        If
the embedded derivative instrument is determined not to be clearly and closely related to the host contract, the financial instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative
instrument and the host contract is not currently measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings; and, if a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative
would qualify as a derivative instrument, then the embedded derivative instrument is recorded apart from the host contract and carried at fair value with changes recorded in current period earnings. 
        Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments, an amendment of
SFAS 133 and SFAS 140 (""SFAS 155""), was effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after December 31, 2006. This Statement: 


Establishes
a requirement to evaluate whether interests in securitized financial instruments contain an embedded derivative that requires bifurcation
Permits
fair value accounting to be elected for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation
Clarifies
which interest-only stripped securities and principal-only stripped securities are not subject to SFAS 133 and
Clarifies
that concentration of credit risks in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives. 

        The
application of SFAS 155 did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial position or earnings of the Company.

COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 

 Sales, Securitizations and Servicing of Financial Instruments  

        The Company sells a significant portion of its mortgage loan production in the secondary mortgage market, either in the form of securities or as whole loans.
By-products of those sales include mortgage servicing rights (""MSRs"") and certain retained interests, such as interest-only securities, principal-only securities
and residual securities, which the Company generally holds as long-term investments. (See Note 3Loan Sales, for a
description of MSRs.) 
        When
the Company sells mortgage loans, it allocates the cost of the mortgage loans between the securities or loans sold and the interests it continues to hold, based on their relative
fair values. Note 3Loan Sales, describes how the Company estimates fair value. The reported gain or loss is the difference between
the proceeds from the sale of the securities or loans and the cost allocated to the securities or loans sold. The proceeds include cash and other assets obtained (i.e., MSRs) less the fair
value of any liabilities incurred (i.e., liabilities for representations and warranties or other recourse provisions). We periodically update our estimates of the fair value of these
liabilities and record the resulting adjustments as a component of gain or loss on sale of loans and securities. 
        The
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets
(""SFAS 156"") effective January 1, 2006. The Company identified MSRs relating to all existing residential mortgage loans as a class of servicing rights and elected to apply fair value
accounting to these MSRs. Presently, this class represents all of the Company's MSRs. 
        As
a result of adopting SFAS 156 and applying fair value accounting to MSRs, the hedge accounting provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities, (""SFAS 133"") no longer apply to the risk management activities of the Company's MSRs. Therefore, concurrent with the election to
carry MSRs at fair value, the Company discontinued fair value hedge accounting under SFAS 133 related to its MSRs. 
        Before
December 31, 2005, MSRs were carried at the lower of amortized cost or estimated fair value. To the extent the MSR was a part of a fair value hedge accounting relationship,
the cost basis was adjusted for the change in value attributable to the hedge risk. This adjustment was reflected in current period earnings. The adjusted cost basis value of the MSR was then assessed
for impairment. If MSRs were impaired, the impairment was recognized in current period earnings and the carrying value of the MSRs was adjusted through a valuation allowance. If the value of the MSRs
subsequently increased, the recovery in value was recognized in current period earnings to the extent of the valuation allowance. 
        For
purposes of performing that MSR impairment evaluation, the Company stratified its servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics including loan type
(fixed-rate or adjustable-rate) and note rate. Fixed-rate loans were stratified into note-rate pools of 50 basis points for note rates between 5% and 8%
and single pools for note rates above 8% and less than or equal to 5%. 
        Management
periodically reviewed the various impairment strata to determine whether the value of the impaired MSRs in a given stratum was likely to recover. When management deemed
recovery of the value to be unlikely in the foreseeable future, a write-down of the MSRs in the stratum to the estimated recoverable value was charged to the valuation allowance. 
        Retained
interests are designated as trading or available-for-sale securities at the time of securitization and are carried at fair value in the consolidated
balance sheets. 
        Trading
securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in current period earnings. The adjustment to record such securities at fair value from allocated basis
is included as a component of gain on sale of loans and securities. Subsequent changes in the value of retained

interests
classified as trading securities are included in current period earnings as a component of impairment of retained interests. 
        Unrealized
gains and losses of retained interests classified as available-for-sale, net of deferred income taxes, are excluded from earnings and reported as a
component of accumulated other comprehensive income, which is included in shareholders' equity. Realized gains and losses on sales of these assets are computed by the specific identification method
and are recorded in earnings as a component of impairment of retained interests
at the time of disposition. Unrealized losses that are other than temporary are recognized in earnings as a component of impairment of retained interests in the period such other than temporary
impairment is identified. Once impairment of retained interests classified as available-for-sale is charged to earnings, subsequent increases in value are recognized in
earnings over the estimated remaining life of the investment through a higher effective yield. 
        Recourse
retained in loan sales and securitization activities is discussed in Note 31Credit Losses Related to Securitized
Loans. 

 Loans  
 Mortgage Loans Held for Sale  

        Mortgage loans held for sale includes mortgage loans originated or purchased for resale together with loans transferred in transactions that do not qualify for
sales treatment under SFAS 140. Mortgage loans originated and purchased for resale are recorded initially at the principal amount outstanding adjusted for any premiums or discounts and the fair
value of any related loan commitment at the time of origination or acquisition. Loan origination fees, as well as incremental direct origination costs, are initially recorded as an adjustment of the
cost of the loan and are reflected in earnings when the loan is sold. 
        The
cost basis of certain mortgage loans held for sale is adjusted to reflect changes in the loans' fair values as applicable through fair value hedge accounting. All mortgage loans held
for sale are carried at the lower of adjusted cost or market, which is computed by the aggregate method (unrealized losses are offset by unrealized gains). The Company generally estimates the fair
value of loans held for sale based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on other relevant
factors, including dealer price quotations, prices available for similar instruments, and valuation models intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from a third party. We regularly
compare the values developed from our valuation models to executed trades to assure that the valuations are reflective of actual sale prices. However, due to the illiquidity of the mortgage
marketplace prevalent at December 31, 2007, which resulted in a lack of executed trades that could be used to assure that the valuations are reflective of fair value, it was necessary to look
for alternative sources of value, including the whole loan purchase market for similar loans, and to apply more judgment to the valuations of non-conforming prime, home equity and nonprime
loans, which represented
approximately 44% of mortgage loans originated or purchased for resale excluding commercial real estate at December 31, 2007. 

 Loans Held for Investment  

        Loans are classified as held for investment based on management's intent and ability to hold the loans for the foreseeable future or to maturity. Loans held for
investment are carried at amortized cost reduced by a valuation allowance for estimated credit losses incurred in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date. A loan's cost includes its unpaid
principal balance along with unearned income, comprised 
F-12



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
of
fees charged to borrowers offset by incremental direct origination costs for loans originated by the Company or any premiums or discounts paid for loans purchased. Loans transferred from loans held
for sale are transferred at the lower of cost or fair value, which becomes the amortized cost basis. The fair value at the time of transfer is determined as described in
LoansMortgage Loans Held for Sale. Unearned income is amortized over the loan's contractual life. For revolving lines of credit, unearned
income is amortized using the straight-line method. For other loans, unearned income is amortized using the interest method. 
        Countrywide
Securities Corporation (""CSC"") may from time to time reacquire securities, which benefit from derivative instruments, which were previously sold to nonaffiliates in the
Company's securitization transactions. These transactions are part of CSC's normal market-making and trading activities and as such the securities are classified as trading securities. For such
reacquired securities not to cause the Company to re-recognize the previously sold assets on its balance sheet, such trading securities may only be held temporarily. If management
subsequently determines that the securities will be held longer than temporarily, the related securitization transaction must be re-recognized as a secured borrowing with loans classified
as held for investment and recorded at their fair value (""Mortgage Loans Held in SPEs"") with an equal and offsetting amount recorded as asset-backed secured financing until the repurchased securities
are sold. 
        During
2007, CSC reacquired securities with embedded derivatives in its market-making and trading activities. After reacquiring those securities, the market for non-agency
mortgage-backed securities was disrupted. Management concluded that certain securities it owned on December 31, 2007 no longer would be held only temporarily. As a result, a liability for
asset-backed secured financings of $5.6 billion and related Mortgage Loans Held in SPEs were included on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2007. 

 Interest Income Recognition  

        Interest income is accrued as earned. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest is 90 days past due, or earlier when
concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest is reversed and interest income is recorded when the
principal balance has been reduced to an amount that is deemed collectible. Loans return to accrual status when principal and interest become current and are anticipated to be fully collectible on a
timely basis. 

 Credit Quality and Loan Impairment  

        The Company provides for incurred losses on loans with an allowance for loan losses. The allowance for losses is a valuation allowance established to provide for
estimated incurred credit losses in the portfolio of loans held for investment as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses is not reduced by amounts estimated to be recoverable through
pool mortgage insurance obtained by the Company. Management estimates the amount of pool mortgage insurance proceeds that will offset its loan losses and records a receivable in other assets with a
corresponding credit to the provision for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a periodic basis by management and is based on a variety of factors, including historical default
and loss rates for similar loans originated by the Company, estimates of collateral value for individually evaluated loans and evaluations of the effect of current economic and market conditions. This
evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as factors change or as more information becomes available. The Company also provides for
losses on unfunded commitments with a liability.

COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
        A
loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest
when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The Company's loan portfolio is comprised primarily of large groups of homogeneous loans made to consumers that are secured by
residential real estate. The Company does not evaluate individual homogenous loans for impairment. These loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days delinquent.
Loans in the Company's warehouse lending and commercial real estate lending portfolios are individually evaluated for impairment on a regular basis. 
        Once
a loan is acquired and included in the Company's portfolio of loans held for investment, Countrywide assesses loan credit quality and estimates its allowance requirement based on
whether the loan is individually evaluated or part of a pool of homogenous loans: 


Homogenous
loans, such as mortgage loans, are evaluated based on the loan's present collection statuswhether the loan is current, delinquent in 30 day
increments, (i.e., current, 30, 60, 90) or in foreclosure or bankruptcy. Our estimate of the required allowance for these loans is developed by estimating both the rate of default of the
loans and the amount of loss in the event of default. The rate of default is assigned to the loans based on their attributes (e.g., original loan-to-value, borrower
credit score, documentation type, etc.) and collection status. The rate of default is based on analysis of migration of loans from each aging category to default over a twelve-month period. Loans more
than 90 days or more past due are assigned a rate of default that measures the percentage of such loans that default over their lives as it is assumed that the condition causing the ultimate
default currently exists. The default rate for the loan is then multiplied by an average loss rate for the type of loan.
Warehouse
lending and commercial real estate loans are individually evaluated both for borrower creditworthiness and for collateral quality. Credit quality is expressed in a
Company-developed credit rating. The allowance for loans that are not identified as impaired is developed by applying credit loss factors applicable to the individual loans' assigned credit grades for
unimpaired loans. The allowance for loans identified as impaired is based on an estimate of recoverability and value of the collateral securing the loans. 

        This
evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as factors change or as more information becomes available. 
        Loans
whose contractual terms have been restructured because the Company, for economic or other reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties, grants a concession to the
borrower that it would not otherwise consider are classified as troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings may include changing repayment terms, reducing the stated interest rate,
reducing the loan's principal balance or accrued interest, or extending the maturity date of the loan. Upon completion of a troubled debt restructuring, a valuation allowance is established to
recognize the impairment of the loan. 
        The
amount of the impairment valuation allowance is established based on whether the loan is collateral dependent and delinquent when the loan is modified: 


Impairment
valuation allowances relating to loans that are collateral dependent and delinquent when they are modified are established with reference to the difference
between the loan's
carrying value and the estimated fair value of the collateral securing the loan reduced by the cost to sell the collateral 

F-14








 


 COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES  
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued)  


Impairment
valuation allowances relating to loans that are not collateral dependent or are collateral dependent but not delinquent when they are modified are established
with reference to the difference between the loan's carrying value and the present value of the estimated cash flows of the loan under its modified terms discounted at the loan's effective interest
rate. 

        Loan
losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the loss is confirmed. We make an initial assessment of whether a charge-off is required on our
mortgage loans no later than the 180th day of delinquency. 

 Trading Securities  

        Trading securities consist of securities purchased by the Company's broker-dealer subsidiary, along with associated derivative instruments used to manage the
price risk of such securities. Trading securities are recorded at fair value on a trade date basis, and gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, are included in gain on sale of loans and
securities in the consolidated statements of operations. 

 Investments in Other Financial Instruments  

        Investments in other financial instruments include mortgage-backed securities, obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises, municipal bonds, U.S.
Treasury securities, derivative financial instruments and certain interests retained in securitization. The Company carries all of these assets at their estimated fair values. Realized gains and
losses on sales of these assets are computed by the specific identification method and are recorded in earnings at the time of disposition. How the changes in fair value of the instruments are
recognized is dependent on the accounting classification of the respective assets: 


Changes
in the fair value of financial instruments accounted for as trading securities are recognized in current period earnings;
All
other instruments are accounted for as available-for-sale securities; therefore, unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred income taxes, are
excluded from earnings and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, which is included in shareholders' equity. Unrealized losses that are other than temporary are recognized
in earnings in the period that the other-than-temporary impairment is identified. Once impairment of retained interests classified as available-for-sale
is charged to earnings, subsequent increases in value are recognized in earnings over the estimated remaining life of the investment through a higher effective yield. 

        Income
on financial instruments retained in securitization is recorded as income from retained interests in the consolidated statements of operations. Income from all other financial
instruments is recorded as interest income. Interest income and income from retained interests is accrued as earned. Unamortized premiums and unaccreted discounts are amortized and accrued to interest
income or income from
retained interests, as appropriate, as an adjustment of the instruments' yields using the interest method. Yields are estimated using market prepayment expectations for similar securities. 

 Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase  

        Transactions involving purchases of securities under agreements to resell, borrowing of securities or sales of securities under agreements to repurchase are
recorded at their contractual amounts plus 
F-15



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
accrued
interest and are accounted for as collateralized financings, except where the Company does not have an agreement to sell (or purchase) the same or substantially the same securities before
maturity at a fixed or determinable price. Transactions that do not provide for the Company to sell (or purchase) substantially the same securities before maturity at a fixed or determinable price are
accounted for as purchases and sales of securities. 
        Certain
of the Company's securities lending arrangements include master netting agreements that entitle Countrywide and its counterparties to settle their positions ""net."" Where such
arrangements are in place, and where the Company or its counterparty intends to settle its positions ""net,"" the Company includes the net asset or liability in its balance sheet. Under master netting
arrangements, $9.0 billion and $30.0 billion of securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed were offset against securities sold under agreements to repurchase
at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 

 Deferred Acquisition Costs  

        The Company's insurance carrier subsidiary, Balboa Insurance Group (""Balboa""), incurs insurance policy acquisition costs that vary with and are directly related
to acquisition of new insurance policies. These costs consist primarily of commissions, premium taxes and certain other underwriting costs. These costs are deferred and amortized as the related
premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are limited to amounts estimated to be recoverable from the related premiums and anticipated investment income less anticipated losses, loss adjustment
expenses and policy maintenance expenses. Deferred acquisition costs totaling $130.8 million and $109.9 million were included in other assets at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. Amortization of policy acquisition costs totaling $227.6 million, $202.6 million and $167.0 million was included in other operating expenses for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

 Liability for Insurance Losses  

        For Balboa's property and casualty policies, the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses consists of an accrual for the unpaid portion of estimated
ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses on claims reported through the end of the accounting period plus estimates, based on past experience, for the estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses
relating to incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. 
        For
credit life and disability policies, liabilities are recorded for future claims, estimated based upon statutory standards, on all policies-in-force at the end
of the period, as well as the present value of amounts not yet due on disability claims. The liability for policy and contract claims represents the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and
unreported claims incurred through the end of the period, except for the present value of amounts not yet due on disability claims, which are included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 
        The
liability for insurance losses is established using statistical analyses and is subject to the effects of trends in claim severity and frequency and other factors. The estimate is
continually reviewed and as adjustments to the liability become necessary, such adjustments are reflected in current period earnings. 
        For
mortgage reinsurance, the liability for insured losses is accrued in proportion to the amount of revenue recognized based on management's assessment of the ultimate liability to be
paid over the current and expected renewal period of the contracts. The remaining liability to be paid, along with reinsurance revenues to be earned, is estimated based on projected defaults, losses
and prepayments.

 Collateral Pledged and Collateral Received  

        The Company reports assets it has pledged as collateral in secured borrowing and other arrangements when the secured party cannot sell or repledge the assets or
the Company can substitute collateral or otherwise redeem it on short notice. 
        The
Company generally does not report assets received as collateral in secured lending and other arrangements since the debtor typically has the right to redeem the collateral on short
notice. 

 Premises and Equipment  

        Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is provided in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of
depreciable assets to operations over their estimated service lives using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the term of the lease or service
life of the improvement using the straight-line method. Renovations and improvements that add utility or significantly extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. Repair and
maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 

 Capitalized Software Costs  

        Internal software development costs are capitalized to the extent of external direct costs of materials and services consumed and of salary costs relating to
employees' time spent on the software project during the application development stage. Internally developed software is amortized over six to ten years using the straight-line method. 
        Capitalized
software costs are evaluated for impairment annually or when changing circumstances indicate that amounts capitalized may be impaired. Impaired items are written down to
their estimated fair values at the date of evaluation. 

 Loan Servicing Fees  

        Loan servicing fees and other remuneration are received by the Company for servicing residential mortgage loans. Loan servicing fees are recorded net of guarantee
fees paid by the Company. Loan servicing fees are recognized as earned over the life of the loans in the servicing portfolio. 

 Income from Retained Interests  

        Income from retained interests represents the yield on interest-only securities, principal-only securities, residual interests and other
financial instruments retained in securitization. Income on these investments is recognized using the interest method. 

 Insurance Premiums  

        Property and casualty and credit life and disability premiums are recognized over the term of the policies on a pro-rata basis for all policies except
for certain of the lender-placed insurance and the guaranteed auto protection (""GAP"") policies. Lender-placed insurance is obtained for the benefit of the lender when a borrower cancels or fails to
renew insurance on a property securing a mortgage loan. GAP insurance provides coverage for leased automobiles' residual values to the lessors of the vehicles. For GAP insurance, revenue recognition
is correlated to the exposure and accelerated over the life of the contract. For lender-placed insurance (except for policies placed on foreclosed real estate), premiums are ""slowed,"" or recognized
later in the life of the policy, due to high cancellation rates experienced early in the life of the policy. Mortgage reinsurance premiums are recognized as earned

COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
over
the life of the policy. Prepaid premiums applicable to the unexpired term of policies-in-force are recorded as unearned premiums in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities. 

 Stock-Based Compensation  

        In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Accounting for Share-Based
Payment, (""SFAS 123R""), the Company charges the unamortized value of previously granted employee stock options to compensation expense. For awards made on or after
January 1, 2006 made to retirement-eligible employees and that vest upon retirement, the Company is required under SFAS 123R to immediately charge the associated value to expense. The
value of grants made on or after January 1, 2006, to other employees must be amortized over the lesser of (a) the nominal vesting period or (b) for options that vest upon
retirement, the period until the grantee becomes retirement-eligible. Prior to January 1, 2006, the Company recognized compensation expense related to its stock option plans only to the extent
that the fair value of the shares at the grant date exceeded the exercise price. 
        As
of December 31, 2007, the Company has awarded stock options and shares of restricted stock that, depending on the year granted and other factors, have different vesting
requirements. Generally, stock options issued before 2004 vest over a period of three to four years and expire five or ten years after the grant date. Stock options awarded in 2004 become vested upon
attainment of specific earnings performance targets or, in any event, four and a half years after the grant date regardless of attainment of the earnings targets and expire five years after the date
of grant. Generally, stock options granted in 2005 were fully vested on the grant date. Stock options and stock appreciation rights awarded in 2006 and 2007 vest over a three-year period
and expire five to ten years after grant date. Off-cycle awards and awards to new employees have various vesting schedules. Generally, restricted stock awards vest over a period of three
years although some restricted stock awards granted in 2004 had a performance-based component similar to the stock options granted that year.

(e.g., risk-free interest rate, stock volatility and dividend rate). It also derives an expected term that captures patterns of exercise by participants prior to the end of the
stated terms of those awards.

Income Taxes  
        Countrywide files a consolidated federal income tax return and a combined income tax return in California and certain other states. Additional income tax returns
are filed on a separate entity basis in various other states and localities. 
        The
Company uses the balance sheet method to account for income taxes. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between
the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes in tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more
likely than not that some portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
        Effective
January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
Taxes (""FIN 48""). FIN 48 was issued to clarify the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting
for Income Taxes, relating to the recognition of income tax benefits. 
        FIN 48
provides a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring tax benefits when the benefits' realization is uncertain. The first step is to determine whether the
benefit is to be recognized; the second step is to determine the amount to be recognized: 


Income
tax benefits should be recognized when, based on the technical merits of a tax position, the entity believes that if a dispute arose with the taxing authority and
were taken to a court of last resort, it is more likely than not (i.e., a probability of greater than 50 percent) that the tax position would be sustained as filed; and
If
a position is determined to be more likely than not of being sustained, the reporting enterprise should recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than
50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. 

        Upon
adoption, the balances of income taxes payable and retained earnings were adjusted for the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of FIN 48 as follows:

total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on uncertain tax positions as of January 1, 2007 was $180.6 million, which included $126.8 million of net unrecognized
tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the Company's effective income tax rate. 
        The
Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax uncertainties in its provision for income taxes and income taxes payable. The after-tax equivalent of
approximately $17.2 million for interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions was included in income taxes payable at January 1, 2007.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
        In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements, (""SFAS 157""). SFAS 157 provides a framework for measuring fair value when such measurements are used for accounting purposes. The framework focuses
on an exit price in the principal (or, alternatively, the most advantageous) market accessible in an orderly transaction between willing market participants. SFAS 157 establishes a three-tiered
fair value hierarchy with Level 1 representing quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market and Level 3 representing estimated values based on unobservable
inputs. Under SFAS 157, related disclosures are segregated for assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on the level used within the hierarchy to determine their fair values. The
Company adopted SFAS 157 on its effective date of January 1, 2008 and the financial impact upon adoption was not material. 
        In
February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, (""SFAS 159""). SFAS 159 permits fair value accounting to be irrevocably elected for certain
financial assets and liabilities on an individual contract basis at the time of acquisition or at a remeasurement event date. Upon adoption of SFAS 159, fair value accounting may also be
elected for existing financial assets and liabilities. For those instruments for which fair value accounting is elected, changes in fair value will be recognized in earnings and fees and costs
associated with origination or acquisition will be recognized as incurred rather than deferred. SFAS 159 is effective January 1, 2008, with early adoption permitted as of
January 1, 2007. The Company adopted SFAS 159 concurrent with the adoption of SFAS 157 on January 1, 2008 and the financial impact upon adoption was not material. 
        In
April 2007, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39, (""FSP
FIN 39-1""). FSP FIN 39-1 amends certain paragraphs of FASB Interpretation Number 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
Contracts,an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 10 and FASB Statement No. 105
(""FIN 39"") to permit a reporting entity to offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against fair value amounts
recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting arrangement. FSP FIN 39-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
November 15, 2007, with early application permitted. Upon application, the Company shall be permitted to change its accounting policy to offset or not offset fair value amounts recognized for
derivative instruments under master netting arrangements. The Company adopted FSP FIN 39-1 on its effective date of January 1, 2008 and the financial impact upon adoption was
not material. 
        In
November 2007, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 109 (""SAB 109""). SAB 109 supersedes Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 105 (""SAB 105""), Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments. It clarifies that the expected net future cash flows
related to the associated servicing of a loan should be included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. However, it retains the
guidance in SAB 105 that internally-developed intangible assets should not be recorded as part of the fair value of a derivative loan commitment. The guidance is effective on a prospective
basis to derivative loan commitments issued or modified in fiscal quarters beginning after December 15, 2007. In conjunction with the adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159, this
guidance generally would result in higher fair values being recorded upon initial recognition of derivative loan commitments.

Note 3Loan Sales  
        The Company routinely originates, purchases and sells mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage market. Prime mortgage loan sales are generally structured
without recourse to the Company. However, the Company generally has limited recourse on the Prime Home Equity and Nonprime Mortgage Loans it securitizes, through retention of a subordinated interest,
through its issuance of a corporate guarantee of losses up to a negotiated maximum amount or in the case of home equity securitizations, the obligation to fund subsequent draws with a subordinated
repayment priority when a rapid amortization event occurs. Recourse retained in loan sales and securitization activities is discussed in Note 31Credit
Losses Related to Securitized Loans. While the Company generally does not retain credit risk on the Prime Mortgage Loans it sells, it has potential liability under
representations and warranties it makes to purchasers and insurers of the loans. 
        Following
is a summary of the Company's liability for representations and warranties included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the periods presented:

        The
Company estimates its liability for impairment losses related to future draw obligations on securitized home equity lines of credit and updates its estimate quarterly. The provision
for estimated losses arising from future draw obligations is recorded as a component of impairment of retained interests. The estimate requires projections of future expected funding obligations under
a rapid amortization event compared to the expected fair value of the amount to be recovered on the required funding date. The resulting value is then discounted to a present value amount based on an
appropriate risk-free interest rate to arrive at the value of the funding obligation. The accrued liability for impairment related to future expected funding obligations under a rapid
amortization event was $704.1 million as of December 31, 2007. 
        The
Company recognized gains of $2.0 billion, $4.7 billion, and $4.0 billion from sales of mortgage loans in securitizations in the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
        When
the Company sells mortgage loans, it generally receives cash and MSRs and, when those sales take the form of securitizations, Countrywide retains financial interests in its loan
sales activities in the form of interest-only, principal-only and subordinated interests. 
        MSRs
arise from contractual agreements between the Company and investors (or their agents) in mortgage securities and mortgage loans. Under these contracts, the Company performs loan
servicing functions in exchange for fees and other remuneration. The servicing functions typically performed include, among other responsibilities, collecting and remitting loan payments; responding
to borrower inquiries; accounting for principal and interest, holding custodial (impound) funds for payment of property taxes and insurance premiums; counseling delinquent mortgagors; and supervising
foreclosures and property dispositions. 
F-22



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
        The
value of MSRs is derived from the net positive cash flows associated with the servicing contracts. The Company receives a servicing fee ranging generally from 0.125% to 0.50%
annually on the remaining outstanding principal balances of the loans. The servicing fees are collected from the monthly payments made by the mortgagors. The Company generally receives other
remuneration including rights to various mortgagor-contracted fees such as late charges, collateral reconveyance charges and loan prepayment penalties and the Company is generally entitled to retain
the interest earned on funds held pending remittance (or ""float"") related to its collection of mortgagor principal, interest, tax and insurance payments. The Company also generally has the right to
solicit the mortgagors for other products and services, such as second mortgages and insurance, as well as for new mortgages for those considering refinancing or purchasing a new home. 
        The
precise market value of MSRs and retained interests cannot be readily determined because these assets are not actively traded in stand-alone markets. Considerable judgment is
required to determine the fair values of these assets and the exercise of such judgment can significantly impact the Company's earnings. Therefore, senior financial management exercises extensive and
active oversight of this process. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee, which is comprised of several senior financial executives, ultimately determines the valuation of MSRs and retained
interests. 
        The
Company's MSR valuation process combines the use of a discounted cash flow model and analysis of current market data to arrive at an estimate of fair value at each balance sheet
date. The cash flow assumptions (which consider only contractual cash flows) and prepayment assumptions used in Countrywide's discounted cash flow model are based on market factors and encompass the
historical performance of our MSRs, which Management believes are consistent with assumptions and data used by market participants valuing similar MSRs. The key assumptions used in the valuation of
MSRs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates (projected London Inter Bank Offering Rate (""LIBOR"") plus option-adjusted spread). These variables can, and generally do, change from quarter
to quarter as market conditions and projected interest rates change. The current market data utilized in the MSR valuation process and in the assessment of the reasonableness of the MSR valuation are
obtained from peer group MSR valuation surveys, MSR market trades, MSR broker valuations and prices of interest-only securities. 
        The
cash flow model and underlying prepayment and interest rate models used to value the MSRs are subjected to validation in accordance with the Company's model validation policies. This
process includes review of the theoretical soundness of the models and the related development process, back testing of actual results to model predictions, benchmarking to commercially available
models and ongoing performance monitoring. 
        For
retained interests, the Company also estimates fair value through the use of discounted cash flow models. The key assumptions used in the valuation of retained interests include
mortgage prepayment speeds, discount rates, and for subordinated interests containing credit risk, the net credit losses over the expected lifetime of the security. The discounted cash flow models
incorporate cash flow and prepayment projections based on data drawn from the historical performance of the loans underlying the Company's retained interests, which management believes are consistent
with assumptions other major market participants would use in determining the assets' fair value.

        These
sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the figures indicate, changes in fair value based on a given percentage variation in individual assumptions
generally cannot be extrapolated. Also, in the preceding tables, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs or retained interests is calculated independently
without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another which might compound or counteract the sensitivities.

Note 4Derivative Financial Instruments  
Derivative Financial Instruments  
        A significant market risk facing the Company is interest rate risk, which includes the risk that changes in market interest rates will result in unfavorable
changes in the value of our assets or liabilities (""price risk"") and the risk that net interest income from our mortgage loan and investment portfolios will change in response to changes in interest
rates. This risk includes both increases in ""risk-free"" rates (usually the U.S. Treasury rate for an asset of the same duration) and changes in the premiums to risk-free rates
of return required by investors. Such changes may be the result of liquidity and/or changing investor perceptions of risk. The overall objective of the Company's interest rate risk management
activities is to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in interest rates. 
        The
Company manages interest rate risk with derivative financial instruments and by the structure of its activities as follows: 


The
Company uses various financial instruments, including derivatives, to manage the interest rate risk related specifically to the values of its commitments to make or
purchase loans (also referred to as interest rate lock commitments or ""IRLCs""), mortgage loans held by the Company pending sale (""Mortgage Loan Inventory""), retained interests and trading securities,
as well as a portion of its debt.
Structurally,
the Company manages interest rate risk in its Mortgage Banking Segment through the natural counterbalance of its loan production and servicing businesses. In
its Banking Segment, the Company manages interest rate risk by funding the segment's interest-earning assets with liabilities of similar duration or a combination of derivative instruments and certain
liabilities that create repricing characteristics that closely reflect the repricing behaviors of those assets. 



 Risk Management Activities Related to Mortgage Loan Inventory and Interest Rate Lock Commitments  
 Description of Risk Management Activities  

        The Company is exposed to price risk relative to its Mortgage Loan Inventory and its IRLCs. The Mortgage Loan Inventory is comprised of mortgage loans held by the
Company pending sale, and is presently held for an average of approximately 25 days. IRLCs guarantee the rate and points on the underlying mortgage or group of mortgages for a specified period,
generally from seven to 75 days. 
F-26



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
        With
regard to loans held for sale, the Company is exposed to price risk from the time an IRLC is made to a mortgage applicant or financial intermediary to the time the resulting
mortgage loan is sold. For loans held for investment, the Company is exposed to price risk from the time an IRLC is made to a financial intermediary to the time the loan is purchased. During these
periods, the Company is exposed to losses if mortgage rates rise or investor yields increase, because the value of the IRLC or mortgage loan held for sale declines. To manage this price risk the
Company uses derivatives. 
        The
price risk management of IRLCs is complicated by the fact that the ultimate percentage of applications that close within the terms of the IRLC is variable. The probability that the
loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC is affected by a number of factors, in particular any change in mortgage rates subsequent to the lock date. This probability generally increases if mortgage
rates rise, and decreases if mortgage rates fall, due primarily to the relative attractiveness of current mortgage rates compared to the applicant's committed rate. The probability that a loan will
fund within the terms of the IRLC is also influenced by the source and age of the application, purpose for the loan (purchase or refinance), and the application approval rate. The Company has
developed closing ratio estimates, using historical experience that take into account all of these variables, as well as renegotiations of rate and point commitments that tend to occur when mortgage
rates fall. Those closing ratio estimates are used to estimate the aggregate balance of loans that will fund within the terms of IRLCs. 
        To
manage the price risk associated with the IRLCs, the Company generally uses a combination of net forward sales of MBS and put and call options on MBS, Treasury futures and Eurodollar
futures. The
Company generally makes forward sales of MBS in an amount equal to the portion of the IRLCs expected to close, assuming no change in mortgage rates. The Company acquires put and call options to
protect against the variability of loan closings caused by changes in mortgage rates. To manage the credit spread component of price risk associated with its IRLCs the Company may enter into credit
default swaps. 
        The
Company manages the price risk related to the Mortgage Loan Inventory primarily by entering into forward sales of MBS and Eurodollar futures. The value of these forward MBS sales and
Eurodollar futures moves in opposite direction to the value of the Mortgage Loan Inventory. To manage the credit spread component of price risk associated with its Mortgage Loan Inventory, the Company
may enter into credit default swaps or similar instruments. The Company actively manages the risk profiles of its IRLCs and Mortgage Loan Inventory on a daily basis. 
        The
Company manages the price risk related to its commercial mortgage loans using interest rate swaps, total rate of return and credit default swaps. 
        The
Company uses the following derivative instruments in its risk management activities related to the IRLCs and Mortgage Loan Inventory: 


Forward Sales of MBS:  An obligation to sell MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The
value increases as mortgage rates rise.
Forward Purchases of MBS:  An obligation to buy MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The
value increases as mortgage rates fall.
Call Options on MBS:  A right to buy MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value
increases as mortgage rates fall.
Put Options on MBS:  A right to sell MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value
increases as mortgage rates rise.
Call Options on U.S. Treasury Futures:  A right to acquire a U.S. Treasury futures contract at a specified price
in the future. The value increases as the benchmark U.S. Treasury rate falls. 

F-27

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 




Put Options on U.S. Treasury Futures:  A right to sell a U.S. Treasury futures contract at a specified price on a

Short Eurodollar Futures Contracts:  The sale of a standardized exchange-traded contract that we do not own, the
value of which is tied to spot Eurodollar rates at specified future dates. The value increases when Eurodollar rates rise.
Credit Default Swaps:  An agreement to purchase credit event protection based on a financial index or security in
exchange for paying a fixed rate fee or premium over the term of the contract. For use in the risk management of commercial and residential mortgage loans, the Company receives credit protection and
pays a fixed fee or premium. The value of these contracts increases when the probability of the occurrence of a credit event rises.

 Accounting for Risk Management Activities  

        The change in value of all derivative instruments used in the risk management activities related to Mortgage Loan Inventory and IRLCs are recorded at fair value
with changes in fair value included as a component of gain on sale of loans and securities in the consolidated statements of operations. 
        IRLCs
that qualify as derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period earnings as a component of gain on sale of loans and
securities. Commitments to make loans held for sale and the Company's commitments to purchase loans qualify as derivative financial instruments. 
F-28



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
        The
Company estimates the fair value of an IRLC based on the change in estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan and the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within
the terms of the IRLC. The change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is measured from the date the IRLC is issued. At the time of issuance the estimated fair value of an IRLC is zero.
Subsequent to issuance, the value of an IRLC can be either positive or negative, depending on the change in value of the underlying mortgage loan. The Company generally estimates the fair value of the
underlying loan based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on other relevant factors,
including dealer price quotations, prices available for similar instruments, and valuation models intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from a third party. We regularly compare
the values developed from our valuation models to executed trades to assure that the valuations are reflective of actual sale prices. However, due to the illiquidity of the mortgage marketplace
prevalent at December 31, 2007, which resulted in a lack of executed trades that could be used to assure that the valuations are reflective of fair value, it was necessary to look for
alternative sources of value, including the whole loan purchase market for similar loans, and to apply more judgment to the valuations of non-conforming prime, home equity and nonprime
loans. 
        During
2007, the interest rate risk management activities associated with 54% of the fixed-rate mortgage loan inventory and 37% of the adjustable-rate mortgage
loan inventory were accounted for as fair value hedges. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized pre-tax losses of $79.8 million,
$116.9 million and $49.7 million, respectively, representing the ineffective portion of the hedges of its Mortgage Loan Inventory that qualified as fair value hedges. These amounts are
included in gain on sale of loans and securities in the consolidated statements of operations. 

 Risk Management Activities Related to Mortgage Servicing Rights and Retained Interests  
 Description of Risk Management Activities  

        MSRs and retained interests, specifically interest-only securities and residual securities, are generally subject to a loss in value when mortgage
interest rates decline. The fair value of MSRs and retained interests are based on the present value of cash flow streams that are closely linked to the expected life of the underlying loans.
Declining mortgage interest rates generally precipitate increased mortgage refinancing activity to the extent that the borrower is able to obtain a new loan. Increased refinancing activity decreases
the expected life of the underlying loans, thereby decreasing the value of the MSRs and most retained interests. Changes in the value of these assets are reflected in current period earnings for MSRs
and retained interests accounted for as trading securities. Impairment of retained interests accounted for as available-for-sale securities is also reflected in current period
earnings; however appreciation in value above such interests' amortized cost
is reflected as a component of other comprehensive income. To moderate the impact on earnings caused by a rate-driven decline in fair value of its MSRs and retained interests from
securitization, the Company maintains a portfolio of financial instruments, including derivatives and securities, which generally increase in value when interest rates decline. In addition, the
Company has used credit-related derivative financial instruments to moderate the negative impact on earnings cause by a credit spread-driven decline in fair value. This portfolio of financial
instruments is collectively referred to herein as the ""Servicing Hedge.""

        The
Company uses the following financial instruments in its Servicing Hedge: 


Receiver Swaptions:  A right to enter into a predetermined Interest Rate Swap at a future date where the Company
receives the fixed rate and pays the floating rate. These contracts increase in value as rates fall.
Payor Swaptions:  A right to enter into a predetermined Interest Rate Swap at a future date, where the Company
pays the fixed rate and receives the floating rate. These contracts increase in value as rates rise.
Interest Rate Swaps:  A mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments; one party paying a fixed rate and
another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest rate (e.g., U.S. Dollar LIBOR (""USD LIBOR"")). For use in the Servicing Hedge, the Company generally receives the fixed rate and pays
the floating rate. Such contracts increase in value as rates fall.
U.S. Treasury Futures:  An agreement to purchase a U.S. Treasury security at a specified price in the future. The
value increases as the benchmark U.S. Treasury rate falls.
Call Options on U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar Futures:  A right to acquire a U.S. Treasury or Eurodollar futures
contract at a specified price in the future. The value increases as the benchmark U.S. Treasury or Eurodollar deposit rate falls.
Mortgage Forward Rate Agreement:  A mutual agreement to exchange a single cash flow at a forward settlement date,
based on the difference between the forward fixed rate and floating rate set equal to the 30-day forward current coupon mortgage rate, known as the constant maturity index on the
settlement date. For use in the Servicing Hedge, the Company generally receives the fixed rate and pays the floating rate. Such contracts increase in value as the spread between the current coupon
mortgage rate and the swap curve tightens, or when interest rates fall.
Forward Sales of MBS:  An obligation to sell MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The
value increases as mortgage rates rise.
Forward Purchases of MBS:  An obligation to buy MBS at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The
value increases as mortgage rates fall.
Put Options on U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar Futures:  A right to sell a U.S. Treasury or Eurodollar futures
contract at a specified price in the future. The value increases as the benchmark U.S. Treasury or Eurodollar deposit rate rises. 

        These
instruments are combined to manage the overall risk portfolio of the MSRs and retained interests. The Company actively manages its MSRs and retained interests risk profile on a
daily basis.

        The
Servicing Hedge is intended to reduce the impact on reported earnings of the decline in value of MSRs and retained interests that generally results from a decline in mortgage rates.
Should mortgage rates increase, the value of the MSRs and retained interests is expected to increase while the value of the Servicing Hedge is expected to decrease. 

 Accounting for Risk Management Activities  

        The changes in fair value of derivative contracts included in the Servicing Hedge are recorded as a component of the gain or loss from the Servicing Hedge in the
consolidated statements of operations. 
        As
a result of electing fair value accounting upon adoption of SFAS 156 effective January 1, 2006, the hedge provisions of SFAS 133 no longer apply to the risk
management activities of the Company's MSRs. Effective April 1, 2005, a portion of the Servicing Hedge qualified as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133. During the nine months ended
December 31, 2005, the portion of the Servicing Hedge that qualified as a fair value hedge covered approximately 28% of the risk associated with a change in fair value of the MSRs attributable
to changes in interest rates of up to 50 basis points. At no other time during the year ended December 31, 2005, did any portion of the Servicing Hedge qualify as a hedge under SFAS 133. 
        For
the nine months ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a loss of $29.3 million in earnings, which represents the amount of hedge ineffectiveness for the
portion of the Servicing Hedge that qualified as a fair value hedge under SFAS 133. 
        There
was no portion of the related hedge instruments' gain or loss that was excluded from the assessment of the hedge effectiveness. 
        Application
of fair value hedge accounting under SFAS 133 resulted in the cost basis of the MSRs being adjusted for the change in fair value of the MSRs attributable to the hedged
risk, with a corresponding amount included as a component of impairment or recovery of MSRs in the statements of operations.

 Risk Management Activities Related to Issuance of Long-Term Debt  
 Description of Risk Management Activities  

        Management's objective in financing the activities of the Company is to ensure access to reliable and cost-effective funding from a variety of sources
in order to meet the Company's financing requirements under various market conditions. These financing activities subject the Company to interest rate risk. Specifically, the Company is exposed to the
risk that the interest expense it incurs on its long-term borrowings will change at a different speed than the income it earns on the assets financed by the long-term debt,
contributing to variability of net income. To address this risk, management seeks long-term debt structured to reprice in a manner similar to the assets it is financing. However, the
Company may not be able to obtain access to borrowings structured to match the repricing characteristics of the assets being financed at optimal interest rates (i.e., cost). Management
addresses this constraint, in part, by entering into interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements designed to modify the structure of its borrowings. These agreements have the effect of changing
the structure of a debt agreement to one that approximates the repricing characteristics of the assets financed. 
        The
Company has entered into interest rate swap contracts in which the rate received is fixed and the rate paid is adjustable and is indexed to LIBOR (""Receiver Swap""). These interest
rate swaps enable the Company to convert a portion of its fixed-rate, long-term debt to U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating-rate debt (notional amount of
$6.7 billion as of December 31, 2007) and a portion of its foreign currency-denominated fixed and floating-rate, long-term debt to U.S. dollar LIBOR-based
floating-rate debt (notional amount of $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2007). These transactions are generally designated as fair value hedges under SFAS 133.

        Payments
on interest rate swaps are based on a specified notional amount and payments are due periodically through the termination date of each contract. The swap contracts expire
between January 2008 and November 2036. 

 Accounting for Risk Management Activities  

        The interest rate swaps are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. 
        For
the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $15.6 million, a pre-tax gain of
$23.3 million, and a pre-tax loss of $2.1 million, respectively, representing the ineffective portion of its fair value hedges of debt. These amounts are included in interest
expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 
        For
the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 the Company recognized no pre-tax gain or loss representing the ineffective portion of such cash flow hedges. For the
year ended December 31, 2005, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $0.5 million, representing the ineffective portion of such cash flow hedges. As of December 31,

 Risk Management Activities Related to Deposit Liabilities  
 Description of Risk Management Activities  

        The Company faces interest rate risk in the interest-earning activities of its Bank. Specifically, the Company is exposed to the risk that the interest expense it
incurs on its deposits will change at a different rate than the income it earns on its interest-earning assets, resulting in variability in net interest income. Management manages this risk by
matching the duration and repricing characteristics of the Bank's interest-bearing liabilities with those of its interest-earning assets. To align the duration and repricing characteristics of its
interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the Company enters into interest rate swap contracts that have the effect of converting a portion of its fixed-rate deposit
liabilities to LIBOR-based variable-rate deposit liabilities.

are due periodically through the termination date of each swap contract. The contracts expire between April 2008 and November 2027. 

 Accounting for Risk Management Activities  

        The Company's interest rate swap transactions are designated as fair value hedges. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company
recognized a pre-tax gain of $2.7 million, a pre-tax loss of $3.0 million, and a pre-tax gain of $0.5 million respectively, representing the
hedge ineffectiveness related to these contracts. These amounts are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. 

 Risk Management Activities Related to the Broker-Dealer Securities Trading Portfolio  
 Description of Risk Management Activities  

        In connection with its broker-dealer activities, the Company maintains a trading portfolio of fixed-income securities, primarily MBS. The Company is exposed to
price changes in its trading portfolio arising from interest rate changes during the period it holds the securities. To manage this risk, the Company utilizes the following derivative instruments: 


Forward Sales of To-Be Announced (""TBA"") MBS:  An obligation to sell agency pass-through
MBS that have not yet been issued on a specified price and at a specified date in the future. The value increases as mortgage rates rise.
Forward Purchases of TBA MBS:  An obligation to purchase agency pass-through MBS that have not yet
been issued at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as mortgage rates fall. 

F-33



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 




Interest Rate Swaps:  A mutual agreement to exchange interest rate payments; one party paying a fixed rate and
another paying a floating rate tied to a reference interest rate (e.g., USD LIBOR). For use in its trading portfolio risk management activities, the Company receives the floating rate and pays
the fixed rate. Such contracts increase in value as rates rise.
Futures Contracts:  A standardized exchange-traded contract, the value of which is tied to the spot Federal Funds
or Eurodollar rates at specified future dates. The value of these contracts increases when Federal Funds or Eurodollar rates fall.
Total rate of return swaps:  An agreement to pay or receive the total return on a financial index or security in
exchange for the payment or receipt of a floating rate of interest over the term of the contract. For use in the risk management of the commercial mortgage portfolio, the Company pays the return on a
published CMBS index and receives the floating rate of interest. The value of these contracts increases as the value of the index declines.
Put Options on Federal Funds and Eurodollar Futures Contracts:  A right to sell Federal Funds or Eurodollar
futures contract at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as the Federal Funds or Eurodollar rate rise.
Call Options on Federal Funds and Eurodollar Futures Contracts:  A right to acquire Federal Funds or Eurodollar
futures contract at a specified price on a specified date in the future. The value increases as the Federal Funds or Eurodollar rate falls.
Short Futures Contract:  The sale of a standardized exchange-traded contract that we do not own, the value of
which is tied to spot Federal Funds or Eurodollar rates at specified future dates. The value of these contracts increases when Federal Funds or Eurodollar rates rise.
Interest Rate Cap:  A right to receive cash if a reference interest rate rises above a contractual strike rate.
The reference interest rates used in the Company's interest rate caps include mortgage rates, U.S. Treasury rates, and USD LIBOR. The value increases as the reference interest rate rises.
Payer Swaptions:  A right to enter a predetermined Interest Rate Swap at a future date where we receive the
floating rate and pay the fixed rate. These contracts increase in value as rates rise.
Receiver Swaptions:  A right to enter a predetermined Interest Rate Swap at a future date where we receive the
fixed rate and pay the floating rate. These contracts increase in value as rates fall.
Forward rate agreement:  A mutual agreement to exchange a single cash flow at a forward settlement date, based on
the difference between the forward fixed rate and floating rate set equal to the 30-day forward current coupon rate. For use in the risk management of the broker-dealer securities trading
portfolio, the Company receives the floating rate and pays the fixed. Such contracts increase in value as rates rise.

 Counterparty Credit Risk  

        The Company has exposure to credit loss in the event of contractual non-performance by its trading counterparties and counterparties to the
over-the-counter derivative financial instruments that we use in our rate risk management activities. The Company manages this credit risk by selecting only counterparties that
the Company believes to be financially strong, spreading the credit risk among many such counterparties, by placing contractual limits on the amount of unsecured credit extended to any single
counterparty and by entering into netting agreements with the counterparties, as appropriate. 
        The
aggregate amount of counterparty credit exposure after consideration of relevant netting agreements at December 31, 2007 and 2006, before and after collateral held by the
Company, is as follows:

        The
Company generally estimates the fair value of loans held for sale based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair value is estimated based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations, prices available for similar instruments, and valuation models intended to approximate the
amounts that would be received from a third party. We regularly compare the values developed from our valuation models to executed trades to assure that the valuations are reflective of actual sale
prices. However, due to the illiquidity of the mortgage marketplace prevalent at December 31, 2007, which resulted in a lack of executed trades that could be used to assure that the valuations
are reflective of fair value, it was necessary to look for alternative sources of value, including the whole loan purchase market for similar loans, and to apply more judgment to the valuations of
non-conforming prime, home equity and nonprime loans, which represented approximately 44% of mortgage loans originated or purchased for resale excluding loans secured by commercial real
estate at December 31, 2007. 
        At
December 31, 2007, the Company had pledged $0.3 billion, $0.01 billion, $4.4 billion and $0.8 billion in mortgage loans held for sale to secure a
secured revolving line of credit, securities sold under
agreements to repurchase, collateral for asset-backed secured financings and to secure Federal Home Loan Bank (""FHLB"") advances, respectively. 
        At
December 31, 2006, the Company had pledged $7.9 billion, $0.6 billion and $0.03 billion in mortgage loans held for sale to secure asset-backed commercial
paper, a secured revolving line of credit and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, respectively.

        It
is the policy of the Company to obtain possession of collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned under securities purchased under agreements to
resell. Collateral is valued daily, and the Company may require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or may return collateral pledged when appropriate. Securities borrowed transactions
require the Company to deposit cash, letters of credit or other collateral with the lender in an amount generally in excess of the market value of the securities borrowed. 
        As

        During
the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company transferred prime, prime home equity and nonprime mortgage loans with an unpaid principal balance of $9.2 billion,
$9.9 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, and a carrying value after recognition of impairment upon transfer of the loans of $8.9 billion, $9.4 billion and
$2.4 billion, respectively, from mortgage loans held for sale to loans held for investment, as the Company decided to hold those loans for the foreseeable future. The impairment in the amount
of $1.1 billion is recorded as a component of gain on sale of loans and securities. 
        Mortgage
loans totaling $62.6 billion and $57.5 billion were pledged to secure FHLB advances and to enable additional borrowings from the FHLB at December 31, 2007
and 2006, respectively. 
        Mortgage
loans held for investment totaling $6.0 billion and $2.9 billion were pledged to secure an unused borrowing facility with the Federal Reserve Bank (""FRB"") at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed loans repurchased from securities totaling $1.3 billion and $0.5 billion were pledged to secure securities
sold under agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
        Mortgage
loans totaling $1.9 billion were pledged to secure a revolving line of credit at December 31, 2007. 
        Mortgage
loans held in SPEs totaling $5.6 billion were pledged to secure asset-backed secured financings at December 31, 2007. These assets were re-recognized
on the Company's consolidated balance sheets at their estimated fair value after management concluded that certain securities it had reacquired as part of its market-making activities would be held
for an other-than temporary period. The carrying value of the mortgage loans held in SPEs includes a fair value discount of $960.7 million at December 31, 2007. 
        As
of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had accepted mortgage loan collateral of $1.0 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively, that it had the contractual
ability to re-pledge. The collateral secures warehouse lending advances. 
        Properties
securing the mortgage loans in the Company's portfolio of loans held for investment are concentrated in the States of California, Florida and Virginia. The following is a

        During
2007, the Company modified loans for borrowers who were not otherwise able to refinance under the terms of the loan modifications. These transactions were classified as troubled
debt restructurings. The majority of these transactions involved modifications of current loans to change their terms from payment-option ARM loans to payment advantage ARM loans with fixed interest
rates for five years. However, because these modifications were not fully underwritten, the Company categorized these transactions as troubled debt restructurings. Accordingly, these loans were placed
on nonaccrual status pending a satisfactory period of performance under the modified terms. 
        Troubled
debt restructurings during 2007 totaled $278.5 million, the majority of which were the conversions of current payment-option ARM loans to payment advantage ARM loans. An
impairment allowance of $11.0 million relating to these loans is included in the allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2007. The average investment in impaired loans, consisting
of troubled debt restructurings and nonperforming warehouse lines of credit, during the year ended December 31, 2007,

was
$68.0 million. Management considered $37.3 million of warehouse lending loans to be impaired as of December 31, 2007. No amounts were considered impaired as of
December 31, 2006. 
        The
Company has placed loans on nonaccrual status totaling $6.0 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Included in total nonaccrual
loans were Government-insured or guaranteed loans totaling $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively and $2.2 billion and
$1.3 billion of loans that we have the option (but not the obligation) to repurchase for which we have not exercised such option at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
        As
of December 31, 2007, $22.1 billion of Banking Operations' residential loan portfolio was covered by supplemental mortgage insurance on specified pools of loans, of
which $15.0 billion represents first loss coverage. The maximum loss coverage available under these policies on a combined basis is $1.5 billion. While these policies generally provide
for first loss coverage, some policies require premium adjustments if claims exceed specified levels. Furthermore, coverage limits vary by policy, with some policies having limits at the pool level,
and others at the loan level. The allowance for loan losses is not reduced by amounts estimated to be recoverable through this mortgage insurance. Management estimates the amount of pool mortgage
insurance proceeds that will offset its loan losses and records a receivable in other assets with a corresponding credit to the provision for loan losses. Management monitors the capital positions of
the mortgage insurance providers to assess their claims paying ability and adjusts its estimate of the collectibility of the mortgage insurance receivable if the respective insurers' ability to pay
claims is deemed to be impaired.

 Concentrations of Credit Risk  

        The Company reviews its portfolio of loans held for investment for concentrations of loans that might contain disproportionate credit risk. Specifically, the
Company's credit risk management staff monitors loan performance by state and by Metropolitan Statistical Area, as well as by product. Underwriting guidelines and investment objectives are adjusted
based on management's assessment of the results of performance monitoring. 
        The
Company has a significant investment in pay-option adjustable-rate and payment advantage loans (together referred to as ""pay-option loans"").
Pay-option loans represent 32% and 45% of the Company's investment in mortgage loans held for investment at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
        Pay-option
ARM loans have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually (subject to recast of the loan if minimum payments are made
and deferred interest limits are reached). Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 71/2% maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan, the
fully amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after either five or ten years and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not subject to the
71/2% payment limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loans' balances. 
        The
difference between the frequency of changes in the loans' interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments to 71/2% per
year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges. Unpaid interest charges are added to the loan balance until the loan's balance increases to a specified
limit, which is no more than 115% of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. 
F-43



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
        Payment
advantage loans have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of five years (subject to recast of the loan if minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits
are reached). If interest deferrals cause the loan's principal balance to reach a certain maximum level within the first ten years, the payment is reset to the interest-only payment; then
at the 10-year point, the fully amortizing payment is required. References to pay-option loans in the following discussion include both pay-option and payment
advantage loans. 
        Assuming
today's interest rates remain unchanged, most borrowers who consistently make the minimum required payment will have the contractual right to make less than the full interest
payment for three to five years from the date of funding, at which time the loan balance limit will be reached and a new monthly payment amount will be required. Our borrowers' ability to defer
portions of the interest accruing on their loans may expose us to increased credit risk. This is because when the required monthly payments for these loans eventually increase, borrowers may be less
able to pay the increased amounts and may be more likely to default than a borrower with a loan whose initial payment provides for full amortization. Our exposure to this higher credit risk is
increased by the amount of deferred interest (often referred to as ""negative amortization"") that has been added to the principal balance. 
        We
supplement our credit risk management practices relating to negatively amortizing ARM loans through a variety of methods, including active borrower communications both before and
after funding, through our underwriting standards and through the purchase of mortgage insurance. Our underwriting standards require that the borrower meet secondary market debt-service
ratio tests based on the borrower making the fully amortizing loan payment and assuming the loan's interest rate is fully indexed. (A fully indexed note rate equals the sum of the current index rate
plus the margin applicable to the loan.) However, most of the pay-option loans we hold were underwritten with stated or limited income documentation. We tightened our underwriting
standards during 2007 to reduce the availability of reduced documentation loans and loans on investor-owned properties and to reduce the maximum loan-to-value or combined
loan-to-value ratio.

(1)Derivative
financial instruments are not included in this table as derivatives are contracts between Countrywide and a counterparty. Countrywide manages its derivatives counterparty
risk by entering into derivatives only with creditworthy counterparties and limiting its exposure to individual counterparties.
(2)These
securities are generally not rated due to their illiquidity and the absence of significant trading activity.

$0.01 billion and $0.04 billion, respectively, of MBS to secure margin calls on derivative instruments and $1.6 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively, of MBS to secure a
borrowing facility with the Federal Reserve Bank.

        Countrywide's Investment Management Committee (""IMC""), a subcommittee of its Asset/Liability Committee, assesses securities classified as
available-for-sale for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. This assessment evaluates whether the Company intends and is able to
recover the amortized cost of the securities when taking into account the Company's present investment objectives and liquidity requirements and whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the
realization of contractual cash flows into question. 
        During
2007, the IMC determined that the Company no longer intends to hold certain obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises and mortgage-backed securities until the
impairment can be recovered. Such securities had a carrying value of $696.3 million and unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income totaling $42.0 million, which
was transferred to earnings during the year ended December 31, 2007. No other-than-temporary impairment was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2006.

 Asset-Backed Commercial Paper  

        The Company formed two special-purpose entities (Park Granada and Park Sienna) to finance certain of its mortgage loans held for sale by issuing commercial paper.
These entities issued commercial paper in the form of extendible short-term secured liquidity notes (""SLNs""). SLNs were issued with initial maturities of up to 180 days; under
certain conditions, the issuer could extend the maturity dates of the SLNs for an additional period of up to 180 days. The SLNs bore interest at prevailing money market rates approximating
LIBOR. Management terminated these facilities effective December 20, 2007, primarily due to lack of liquidity in the asset-backed commercial paper market. 
        Financial
data pertaining to SLNs were as follows:

are financed through the issuance of asset-backed commercial paper. The entity incurs interest based on prevailing money market rates approximating the cost of asset-backed commercial paper. At
December 31, 2007, the entity had aggregate commitments from the banks that sponsor the conduits totaling $10.4 billion and had $1.5 billion of outstanding borrowings, secured by

the Company's unsecured commercial paper programs. All of the facilities contain various financial covenants and restrictions, certain of which require the Company to maintain specified net worth
amounts. Management believes the Company was in compliance with those covenants and restrictions at December 31, 2007.

COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
        During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company issued $1.7 billion and $2.2 billion of floating-rate and
fixed-rate medium-term notes, respectively. The fixed-rate medium-term notes issued were effectively converted to floating-rate debt using
interest rate swaps. 
        During
the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company redeemed $8.3 billion of maturing medium-term notes. 
        As
of December 31, 2007, $4.0 billion of foreign currency-denominated medium-term notes were outstanding. Such notes are denominated in Euros, Pounds Sterling,
Australian Dollars, Canadian Dollars, and Swiss Francs. These notes have been effectively converted to U.S. dollar-denominated debt through currency swaps. 

 Asset-Backed Secured Financings  

        The Company recorded certain securitization transactions as secured borrowings because they did not meet the accounting criteria for sales treatment. The amounts
accounted for as secured borrowings totaled $3.8 billion and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had
pledged unpaid principal balances of $4.4 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively of mortgage loans held for sale to secure these borrowings. 
        During
2007, CSC reacquired securities with embedded derivatives in its market-making and trading activities. After reacquiring those securities, the market for non-agency
mortgage-backed securities was disrupted. Management concluded that certain securities it owned on December 31, 2007 no longer would be held only temporarily. As a result, a liability of
$5.6 billion and related Mortgage Loans Held in SPEs were included on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2007. 

 Convertible Debentures  

        As detailed in a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 29, 2007, in May 2007, the Company issued
$4.0 billion series A and B floating rate convertible debentures. The debentures bear interest at rates indexed to LIBOR and are guaranteed by one of the Company's

Note 16Committed Reusable Purchase Facilities  
        As of December 31, 2007, the Company had in place a reusable $5.0 billion commitment from a group of multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper
conduits to purchase conventional, conforming loans held for sale from the Company. These multi-seller commercial paper conduits were established and are owned by several major, third-party financial
institutions. Using funds raised through the issuance of commercial paper, the conduits purchase residential mortgage loans from the Company, either directly or through a trust or other vehicle. The
Company has no obligation to repurchase loans from these conduits other than for breach of representations and warranties made by the Company in connection with the sale of the loans. The Company has
no direct or indirect financial ownership or other interest in these conduits. Accordingly, transfers of loans to this facility are accounted for as sales. As consideration for the facility, CHL pays
an annual commitment fee. CHL's commitment fee expense relating to the facility totaled $3.3 million, $3.1 million and $4.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

        At
December 31, 2007, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $0.6 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively, which, if unused, will
expire at varying dates through 2027. 
        A
valuation allowance has been established with respect to certain state net operating loss carryforwards where the Company has deemed it more likely than not that future taxable income
in the relevant taxing jurisdictions will be insufficient to realize the related income tax benefits. 
        Foreign
pre-tax earnings approximated $24.3 million, $34.9 million and $43.6 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 
        Earnings
of a foreign subsidiary are subject to U.S. taxation when effectively repatriated. The Company is required to provide U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of
non-U.S. subsidiaries except to the extent such earnings are indefinitely invested outside the U.S. At December 31, 2007, $103.5 million of accumulated undistributed earnings
on non-U.S. subsidiaries was indefinitely invested outside the U.S. It is not practicable at this time to determine the income tax liability that would result upon repatriation of these
earnings. No income tax is provided against other comprehensive income for the translation adjustments for such unremitted earnings of a subsidiary that are indefinitely invested outside of the U.S.

        As
of December 31, 2007, the Company is not aware of any tax positions for which it was reasonably possible that a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the
next twelve months would significantly impact the Company's effective income tax rate. 
        The
Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax uncertainties in its provision for income taxes and income taxes payable. The Company had the after-tax
equivalent of approximately $27.0 million accrued for interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2007. 
        The
tax years that remain subject to examination are 2005 and forward by the Internal Revenue Service, and 2002 and forward by the California Franchise Tax Board. 
Note 18Shareholders' Equity  

 Series B Convertible Preferred Stock  

        The Company issued 20,000 shares of Series B non-voting convertible preferred stock, par value $0.05 per share, for an aggregate price of
$2.0 billion. Each preferred share is entitled to receive cash dividends, payable quarterly if declared, at the annual rate of 7.25% of the liquidation preference, which initially is equal to
$100,000 per share (""liquidation preference""), or $1,812.50 per share per quarter. Dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and
November 15 of each year. If the dividends are not paid for six quarters, holders of the preferred stock are entitled to designate two directors to the Company's Board of Directors until
dividends have been paid for two consecutive quarters. 
        The
preferred stock ranks senior to the Company's common stock with respect to payment of dividends and distributions upon liquidation. Holders of the preferred shares are entitled to
receive, in the event that the Company is liquidated, dissolved or wound up, the liquidation preference plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends, regardless of whether they were declared. 
        Each
share of preferred stock is convertible, at any time, in whole or in part at the option of the holder, into shares of common stock equal to the liquidation preference divided by $18
(""conversion price""), subject to adjustments, plus cash in an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends. The holders of the preferred stock may not sell, transfer or dispose of any shares
of common stock
received upon conversion of the preferred stock at any time during the 18 month period following the date of conversion. The holders of the preferred stock are subject to restrictions
prohibiting them from, among other things, acquiring beneficial ownership of additional voting securities of the Company. 
        The
Company has the right, at its option, to redeem the outstanding preferred stock, if the daily closing price of the Company's common stock exceeds 150% of the conversion price for 30
consecutive

trading
days on or after August 22, 2017, by paying the liquidation preference in cash and any accumulated and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock. 

 Share Repurchase Program  

        In November 2006, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $2.5 billion. In connection with this program, the
Company repurchased 60,143,388 shares of its common stock for $2.4 billion. 

 Shareholders' Rights  

        In February 1988, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right (""Right"") for each outstanding share of
the Company's common stock. As a result of stock splits and stock dividends, 0.25 of a Right is presently associated with each outstanding share of the Company's common stock issued before the
Distribution Date (as defined below). Each Right, when exercisable, entitles the holder to purchase from the Company one two-thousandth of a share of Series A Participating
Preferred Stock, par value $0.05 per share, of the Company (the ""Series A Preferred Stock""). In June 2006, the purchase price was adjusted to $624, subject to adjustments in certain cases to
prevent dilution. 
        The
Rights are evidenced by the common stock certificates and are not exercisable or transferable, apart from the common stock, until the date (the ""Distribution Date"") of the earlier of
a public announcement that a person or group, without prior consent of the Company, has acquired 15% or more of the common stock (""Acquiring Person""), or 10 days (subject to extension by the
Board of Directors) after the commencement of a tender offer made without the prior consent of the Company. 
        In
the event a person becomes an Acquiring Person, then each Right (other than those owned by the Acquiring Person) will entitle its holder to purchase, at the then current exercise
price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock, or the equivalent thereof, of the Company, which at the time of such transaction, would have a market value of two times the exercise price
of the Right. The Board of Directors of the Company may delay the exercise of the Rights during the period in which they are exercisable only for Series A Preferred Stock (and not common
stock). 
        In
the event that, after a person has become an Acquiring Person, the Company is acquired in a merger or other business combination, as defined for the purposes of the Rights, each Right
(other than those held by the Acquiring Person) will entitle its holder to purchase, at the then current exercise price of the Right, that number of shares of common stock, or the equivalent thereof,
of the other party (or publicly-traded parent thereof) to such merger or business combination which at the time of such transaction would have a market value of two times the exercise price of the
Right. In November 2001, the Company extended the life of the Rights to February 10, 2012. 
        As
more fully detailed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 17, 2008, the Company amended its rights
agreement to provide that the issuance or rights under the rights agreement will not be triggered as a result of the transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

F-72



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
        The
following describes the methods used by the Company in estimating fair values: 

 Mortgage Loans Held for Sale  

        The Company estimates the fair value of loans held for sale based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans when quotes are
available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations, prices available for similar instruments, and
valuation models intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from a third party. We regularly compare the values developed from our
valuation models to executed trades to assure that the valuations are reflective of actual sale prices. However, due to the illiquidity of the mortgage marketplace prevalent at December 31,
2007, which resulted in a lack of executed trades that could be used to assure that the valuations are reflective of fair value, it was necessary to look for alternative sources of value, including
the whole loan purchase market for similar loans, and to apply more judgment to the valuations of non-conforming prime, home equity and nonprime loans, which represented approximately 44%
of mortgage loans originated or purchased for resale excluding loans secured by commercial real estate at December 31, 2007. 

 Trading Securities  

        Fair value for U.S. Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities is determined using quoted market prices. If quoted market prices are not available, which is
generally the case for other types of securities held in the trading portfolio, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations, prices available for
similar instruments, and valuation pricing models intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of the securities. 

 Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, Securities Borrowed and Federal Funds Sold  

        These financial instruments are recorded at accreted cost. Fair value was determined by calculating the net present value of future cash flows of each contract.
The discount rate used was the market rate that would be required to enter these same contracts at the balance sheet date. Fair value was considered to be equal to book value for some contracts, such
as those with open or overnight maturities. 

 Loans Held for Investment  

        Fair value is estimated through the use of discounted cash flow valuation models. The key assumptions that are used in the valuation of loans held for investment
include mortgage prepayment speeds, credit loss assumptions, the market participants' required return on equity, equity level and cost of funds. The Company has incorporated mortgage prepayment and
credit loss assumptions, which include expectations of home price changes, in its valuation models that it believes other major market participants would consider in deriving the fair value of its
loans held for investment. In order to reflect current uncertainties and illiquidity apparent in the secondary mortgage market, the required return on equity used in our valuation process at
December 31, 2007 were higher than the returns demanded by market participants in the past. In order to reflect the significant disruption in mortgage financing
markets, the Company used higher cost of funds assumptions than have been experienced in the past. Estimation of fair value of loans held for investment is inherently judgmental because there is
limited trading of seasoned loan portfolios. 
        Warehouse
lending advances and re-warehoused FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed loans are recorded at realizable value, which approximates fair value.

 Investments in Other Financial Instruments:  
 Principal-Only Securities  

        Fair value is estimated through the use of a proprietary, ""static"" (single rate path) discounted cash flow model. The Company has incorporated mortgage prepayment
assumptions in its valuation that it believes other major market participants would consider in deriving the fair value of principal-only securities. 

 Interest-Only Securities  

        Fair value is estimated through the use of a proprietary, multiple rate path discounted cash flow model. The Company has incorporated mortgage prepayment
assumptions in its valuation model that it believes other major market participants would consider in deriving the fair value of interest-only securities. 

 Interests Retained in Securitization  

        Fair value of retained interests, with the exception of interest-only securities and mortgage-backed securities, is estimated through the use of
proprietary, ""static"" (single rate path) discounted cash flow models. The Company has incorporated mortgage prepayment and credit loss assumptions in its valuation models that it believes other major
market participants would consider in deriving the fair value of its retained interests. 

 Mortgage-Backed Securities  

        Fair value for agency mortgage-backed securities is estimated using observable market prices. If observable market prices are not available, which is generally
the case for non-agency mortgage-backed securities, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations, prices available for similar instruments,
and valuation pricing models intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of the securities. 

 Collateralized Mortgage Obligations  

        Fair value is estimated using valuation pricing models intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of
the contracts. 

 U.S. Treasury Securities and Obligations of U.S. Government-Sponsored Enterprises  

        Fair value is estimated using quoted market prices. 

 Other Financial Instruments  

        Other financial instruments are primarily composed of tax-exempt municipal bonds, asset-backed securities and foreign government bonds. Fair value is
estimated using quoted market prices. 

 Notes Payable  

        Fair value is estimated by discounting remaining payments using applicable current market rates which take into account changes in the Company's marketplace
credit ratings.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 

 Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase and Federal Funds Purchased  

        Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are recorded at their accreted balances. Fair value was determined by calculating the net present value of future
cash flows of each contract. The discount rate used was the market rate that would be required to enter these same contracts at the balance sheet date. Fair value was considered to be equal to book
value for some contracts, such as those with open or overnight maturities. 

 Trading Securities Sold, Not Yet Purchased  

        Fair value is estimated using quoted market prices. 

 Deposit Liabilities  

        The fair value for the checking account and money market liabilities is equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. (This value is also the
carrying amount.) The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated with a discounted cash flow calculation using interest rates currently being offered on similar accounts. 

 Corporate Guarantees  

        Fair value is estimated through the use of a proprietary model consisting of a loan-level frequency model estimated with survival analysis and a
loan-level severity model estimated with multiple least square regressions. The modeling process incorporates the use of relevant risk factors. 

 Derivatives  

        Fair value is defined as the amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date. Market or dealer quotes are available
for many derivatives; otherwise, pricing or valuation models are applied using current market information to estimate fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of an IRLC based on the change in
estimated fair value of the underlying mortgage loan and the probability that the mortgage loan will fund within the terms of the IRLC. The change in fair value of the underlying mortgage loan is
measured from the date the IRLC is issued. At the time of issuance the estimated fair value of an IRLC is zero. Subsequent to issuance, the value of an IRLC can be either positive or negative
depending on the change in value of the underlying mortgage loan. The Company generally estimates the fair value of the underlying loan based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar
types of loans. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is estimated based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations, prices available for similar instruments, and
valuation models intended to approximate the amounts that would be received from a third party. We regularly compare the values developed from our valuation models to executed trades to assure that
the valuations are reflective of actual sale prices. However, due to the illiquidity of the mortgage marketplace prevalent at December 31, 2007, which resulted in a lack of executed trades that
could be used to assure that the valuations are reflective of fair value, it was necessary to look for alternative sources of value, including the whole loan purchase market for similar loans, and to
apply more judgment to the valuations of non-conforming prime, home equity and nonprime loans. 

 Commitments to Extend Credit  

        The fair value of commitments to extend credit represents the fair value of loan commitments related to loans that will be originated for investment. The fair
value is based on observed market

Note 20Employee Benefits  

 Stock Compensation Plans  

        The Company has stock compensation plans (the ""Plans"") that provide for the granting of both qualified and non-qualified stock options, stock
appreciation rights and shares of restricted stock to employees and directors. Stock options and stock appreciation rights are granted at the average market price of the Company's common stock on the
date of grant and are generally exercisable beginning one year from the date of grant and expire up to 10 years from the date of grant. Stock options and stock appreciation rights generally
vest over a period of three to four years. In 2007, the Company extended the life of 9.7 million stock options. Upon extension the Company recorded $7.0 million in compensation expense
relating to these awards for the year ended December 31, 2007. 
        Stock

The
Company recorded compensation expense relating to restricted stock totaling $17.1 million, $11.8 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. The balance of unamortized restricted stock awards was $25.4 million and $10.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
        In
November 2007, the Company awarded 4.7 million cash settled restricted stock units which vest over a three-year period to employees at no cost to them. The Company
recorded
compensation expense relating to these awards totaling $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. The balance of the unamortized awards was $34.1 million at
December 31, 2007. 

 Pension Plan  

        The Company provides retirement benefits to its employees using a variety of plans. For employees hired before January 1, 2006, the Company has a defined
benefit pension plan (the ""Pension Plan""). For employees hired after December 31, 2005 the Company may make supplemental contributions to employee 401(k) Plan accounts. 
        The
Company's policy is to contribute the amount actuarially determined to be necessary to pay the benefits under the Pension Plan, and in no event to pay less than the amount necessary
to meet the minimum funding standards of ERISA. In the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company concluded that no contribution was necessary for the 2006 plan year to meet the minimum funding
standards of ERISA. Accordingly, the Company did not make a contribution to the Pension Plan for the plan year 2006. 
        In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans,
(""SFAS 158""), an amendment of FASB Statement Nos. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). SFAS 158 requires a liability (or an asset) to be recorded that reflects the underfunded (or overfunded)
status of its postretirement benefit plans. SFAS 158 pertains to the Company's Pension Plan and other defined benefit plans. The portion of that liability (or asset) that has not been
recognized in earnings is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (a component of equity), net of taxes. SFAS 158 also requires the measurement date for those obligations to coincide
with an entity's fiscal year-end, which is the measurement date currently used by the Company. SFAS 158 is effective as of December 31, 2006. The following table illustrates
the incremental effect of applying SFAS 158 on individual line items in the balance sheet for December 31, 2006:

expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, was $86.5 million, $80.2 million and $71.1 million, respectively. The Company makes
contributions to the Pension Plan in amounts that are deductible in accordance with federal income tax regulations. 
        The
Company reviews historical rates of return for equity and fixed-income securities, as well as current economic conditions, to determine the expected long-term rate of
return on Plan assets. The Pension Plan's total portfolio is currently estimated to return 7.0% over the long-term. The assumed rate of return is based on historical as well as forecasted
returns for the asset categories into which the Pension Plan's assets will be invested, given the targeted asset allocation levels. Consideration is given to diversification and periodic rebalancing
of the portfolio based on prevailing market conditions. 
        The
Company's Pension Plan weighted-average asset allocations by asset category are as follows:

        The
Company's pension trust assets are invested with a long-term focus to achieve a return on investment that is based on levels of liquidity and investment risk that
management believes are prudent and reasonable. The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed-income investments. The equity investments are diversified across U.S. and
non-U.S. equities. U.S. equity securities are diversified among growth strategies, as well as small and large capitalization strategies. Equity securities do not include any Company stock
or debt securities. The portfolio's asset mix is reviewed regularly, and the portfolio is rebalanced based on existing market conditions. Investment risk is measured and monitored on a regular basis
through quarterly portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements and periodic asset/liability analyses. 
        The
following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid:

 Defined Contribution Plan  

        The Company has a defined contribution plan (""401(k) Plan"") covering all eligible employees of the Company who are age 21 or older. Participants may contribute up
to 40% of pre-tax annual compensation, as defined in the plan document, subject to certain regulatory restrictions. Participants

COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
may
also contribute, at the discretion of the plan administrator, amounts representing distributions from other qualified defined benefit or contribution plans. The Company makes a discretionary
matching contribution equal to 50% of the participant contributions up to a maximum contribution of 6% of the participants' compensation, as defined in the plan document. In the year ended
December 31, 2005, the 401(k) Plan was amended to permit the Company to make an additional contribution to the accounts of employees hired after December 31, 2005. The 401(k) Plan is
subject to the provisions of ERISA. The Company recorded $62.0 million, $43.6 million, and $37.2 million in expense for its contributions for the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

 Other Employee Benefit Plans  

        The Company has various non-qualified retirement and deferred compensation plans for directors and selected employees. The combined liability for
these deferred compensation plans was $366.8 million and $367.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
        The
Company also has a non-qualified defined benefit pension plan for selected executives along with a separate agreement that provides additional benefits to the Company's
chief executive officer (collectively, the ""SERP""). Effective January 1, 2006, the SERP is no longer available to new participants. The Company established a non-qualified defined
contribution pension plan (the ""CECP"") effective January 1, 2006, as a supplemental retirement plan for executives.
The actuarially calculated accumulated benefit obligation for the SERP was $51.4 million and $48.9 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
        The
Company informally funds some of the Plans with trust-owned life insurance and mutual funds to assist the Company in meeting its obligations. The assets are held within rabbi trusts.
The Company's obligations to pay these benefits, the assets held to settle the Company's obligations and the related earnings on the assets and plan expenses are included in the Company's financial
statements. The cash surrender values of the trust-owned life insurance related to these plans are included in other assets and totaled $307.9 million and $319.9 million at
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The related mutual funds totaled $17.6 million and $53.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and are included in
other assets. 
Note 21Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements  
        On March 12, 2007, the Bank converted its charter from a national bank to a federal savings bank. As a result of this conversion, the Company became a
savings and loan holding company, and is no longer a bank holding company. As a savings and loan holding company, Countrywide Financial Corporation is no longer subject to specific statutory capital
requirements. Countrywide Bank's capital is calculated in compliance with the requirements of the Office of Thrift Supervision (""OTS""), which are similar to those of the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency, the Bank's former regulator. The Company is also subject to U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Government National Mortgage Association
(""Ginnie Mae"") net worth requirements, which are lower than those of the OTS. Management believes the Company is in compliance with those requirements. 
        Regulatory
capital is assessed for adequacy by three measures: Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital and Total Risk-Based Capital. Tier 1
Capital includes common shareholders' equity; preferred stock and capital securities that meet certain guidelines detailed in the capital regulations, less goodwill; the portion of MSRs not includable
in regulatory capital (MSRs includable in regulatory capital are limited to the lesser of the carrying value of MSRs, 100% of Tier 1 capital, or 90% of the fair value of 
F-82



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 

the
MSRs, net of associated deferred taxes) and other adjustments. Tier 1 Capital is measured with respect to average assets during the quarter. The Bank is required to have a Tier 1
Capital ratio of 4.0% to be considered adequately capitalized and 5.0% to be considered well capitalized. 
        The
Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio is calculated as a percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of the quarter. The Bank is required to have a
Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital ratio of 4.0% to be considered adequately capitalized and 6.0% to be considered well capitalized. 
        Total
Risk-Based Capital includes preferred stock and capital securities excluded from Tier 1 Capital, mandatory convertible debt, and subordinated debt that meets
certain regulatory criteria. The Total Risk-Based Capital ratio is calculated as a percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of the quarter. The Bank is required to have a
Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of 8.0% to be considered adequately capitalized and 10.0% to be considered well capitalized. 
        The
Bank is required by OTS regulations to maintain tangible capital of at least 1.5% of assets. However, the Bank is also required to maintain a tangible equity ratio of at least 2% to
avoid being classified as ""critically undercapitalized."" Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the prompt corrective action provisions of the Financial Institution Reform Recovery
and Enforcement Act of 1989. The Bank's tangible capital ratio was 8.0% and 7.6% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 
        The
Bank is subject to federal and state laws limiting the payment of dividends. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, an FDIC-insured institution may not pay dividends
while it is undercapitalized or if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized. The OTS also generally prohibits the declaration of a dividend out of the capital and surplus of a bank. The
amount of dividends that the Bank may distribute in a calendar year without OTS approval is limited to the sum of the Bank's net income for the calendar year-to-date plus the
net income of the preceding two years, all reduced by the dividends declared in the period. The OTS has prescribed that the Company and its affiliates are not authorized to receive, and the Bank is
not authorized to pay the Company or its affiliates, capital distributions without receipt of prior written OTS non-objection. For 2008 with non-objection from the OTS, the Bank can
declare dividends totaling $2.0 billion plus its net profits for 2008, up to the date of dividend declaration. As of December 31, 2007, the Bank's retained earnings unavailable for
dividends totaled $495.1 million. 
        At
December 31, 2007, the Bank's regulatory capital ratios and amounts and minimum required capital ratios to maintain a ""well capitalized"" status were as follows:

        The
Company and CHL are required to maintain specified levels of shareholders' equity to remain a seller/servicer in good standing by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Such equity requirements generally are tied to the size of CHL's servicing portfolio. At December 31, 2007, the Company and
CHL's equity requirements for these agencies ranged up to $1.2 billion. The Company had agency capital of $13.5 billion and CHL had agency capital ranging from
$2.9 billion to $3.6 billion at December 31, 2007. 
        Countrywide
Securities Corporation is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission Uniform Net Capital Rule, which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. Countrywide
Securities Corporation has elected to use the alternative method, which, as defined in the rule, requires that the Company maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of $250,000 or 2% of
aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions. Countrywide Securities Corporation's net capital was $1,022.9 million and $586.4 million and net capital in excess of the
minimum required was
$1,020.0 million and $554.0 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits CSC from withdrawing equity capital or making distributions
to Countrywide Financial Corporation if the resulting net capital would be less than 5% of aggregate debits arising from customer-related receivables as computed in accordance with the rule.

Note 24(Loss) Earnings Per Share  
        Basic (loss) earnings per share is determined using net (loss) earnings (adjusted for dividends declared on preferred stock) divided by the weighted-average
common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average shares outstanding, assuming all
dilutive potential common shares were issued. Due to the loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2007, no potentially dilutive shares are included in loss per
share calculation as including such shares in the calculation would be anti-dilutive. 
        The
Company has potentially dilutive shares in the form of employee stock-based compensation instruments (primarily stock options), convertible debentures and convertible preferred
stock. As detailed in Note 15Notes PayableConvertible Debentures, in May 2007, the Company issued two series of
convertible debentures totaling $4.0 billion. As detailed in Note 18Shareholders' EquitySeries B Convertible Preferred
Stock, the Company issued $2.0 billion of convertible preferred stock on August 22, 2007. During 2006 and 2005, the Company had outstanding
zero-coupon convertible securities that under certain conditions were convertible into cash and the Company's common stock. The remaining convertible securities were converted through the
payment of cash and issuance of common stock early in 2006. 
        The
terms of the preferred stock agreement allow the shares to be converted at any time at a conversion price of $18 per share, which was below the closing price of the Company's stock
of $21.82 on August 22, 2007, the date of the preferred stock agreement. Because of the beneficial conversion price in relation to the stock price on August 22, 2007 along with the
immediate convertibility of the shares of preferred stock, the loss attributable to common shareholders has been increased by the value of this beneficial conversion feature, which amounted to
$424.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The effect of this beneficial conversion feature has been reflected in shareholders'

Note 26Restructuring Charges  
        During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company initiated a program to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies in response to lower mortgage
market origination volumes and other market conditions. As part of this plan, the Company expects to incur lease and other contract termination costs. Management recorded restructuring charges
totaling $144.6 million and expects to incur an additional $15 million to $25 million in the first quarter of 2008. Specific actions taken in 2007 include reducing the workforce
by approximately 11,000 and the closure of 259 branches. These reductions occurred in most geographic locations and levels of the organization. The restructuring charges were recorded in the Other
segment.

COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
Note 27Segments and Related Information  
        The Company has five business segments: Mortgage Banking, Banking, Capital Markets, Insurance and Global Operations. 
        The
Mortgage Banking Segment is comprised of three sectors: Loan Production, Loan Servicing and Loan Closing Services. 
        The
Loan Production Sector originates prime and nonprime loans for sale or securitization through a variety of channels on a national scale. Historically, mortgage banking loan
production has occurred in CHL. Over the past several years, we have been transitioning this production to our bank subsidiary, Countrywide Bank. As of December 31, 2007 over 90% of our monthly
mortgage loan production occurred in Countrywide Bank. Effective January 1, 2008, our production channels have moved into the Bank, completing the migration of substantially all of our loan
production activities from CHL to the Bank. The mortgage loan production, the related balance sheet and the income relating to the holding and sale of these loans is included in our Mortgage Banking
Segment regardless of whether the activity
occurred in CHL or Countrywide Bank. The Loan Production Sector is comprised of three lending channels: 


Retail
Channel sources mortgage loans primarily from consumers through the Company's retail branch network and call centers, as well as through real estate agents and
homebuilders
Wholesale
Lending Channel sources mortgage loans primarily from mortgage brokers
Correspondent
Lending Channel purchases mortgage loans from other mortgage lenders, including financial institutions, commercial banks, savings and loan associations, home
builders and credit unions. 

        The
Loan Servicing Sector includes investments in MSRs and retained interests, as well as the Company's loan servicing operations and subservicing for other domestic financial
institutions. The Loan Closing Services Sector is comprised of the LandSafe companies, which provide credit reports, appraisals, title reports and flood determinations to the Company's Loan Production
Sector, as well as to third parties. 
        The
Banking Segment includes Banking Operationsprimarily the investment and fee-based activities of Countrywide Banktogether with the activities of
Countrywide Warehouse Lending and certain loans held for investment and owned by Countrywide Home Loans. Banking Operations invests in mortgage loans sourced from the Loan Production Sector and
mortgage loans and high-quality MBS purchased from non-affiliated entities. Countrywide Warehouse Lending provides third-party mortgage lenders with temporary financing secured
by mortgage loans. 
        The
Capital Markets Segment includes the operations of Countrywide Securities Corporation, a registered broker-dealer specializing in the mortgage securities market. It also includes the
operations of Countrywide Asset Management Corporation, Countrywide Commercial Real Estate Finance Inc., Countrywide Servicing Exchange, Countrywide Alternative Investments Inc., CSC
Futures Inc., Countrywide Capital Markets Asia (H.K.) Limited, CAA Management Inc., Countrywide Sunfish Management LLC and Countrywide Derivative Products, Inc. 
        The
Insurance Segment includes Balboa Insurance Group, a national provider of property, casualty, life, disability and credit insurance; Balboa Reinsurance Company, a primary mortgage
reinsurance
company; and Countrywide Insurance Services, a national insurance agency offering a specialized menu of insurance products directly to consumers. 
F-90



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
        The
Global Operations Segment includes Countrywide International Technology Holdings Limited, a licensor of loan origination processing, servicing and residential real estate value
assessment technology; CFC India Private Limited, a provider of call center, data processing and information technology related services; and CFC International (Processing Services), Limited, located
in Costa Rica, a provider of call center and data processing services. 
        Segment
selection was based upon internal organizational structures, and the process by which these operations are managed and evaluated, including how resources are allocated to the
operations. 
        Intersegment
transactions are generally recorded on an arms-length basis. However, prior to October 2007, the fulfillment fees paid by Banking Operations to the Production
Sector for origination costs incurred on mortgage loans funded by Banking Operations were generally determined on an incremental cost basis, which may be less than the fees that Banking Operations
would pay to a third party.

(1)Earnings
per share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share amounts may not equal the annual amount. This
is caused by rounding and the averaging effect of the number of share equivalents utilized throughout the year, which changes with the market price of the common stock.

(1)Comparative
data not included for the year in which the state was not in the top five of our servicing portfolio. 

 Servicing Compensation  

        As compensation for performance of servicing functions under its various loan servicing contracts, the Company is paid a monthly service fee that is generally
expressed as a percentage of the current unpaid principal balance of the underlying loans. The loan servicing contracts generally specify a base service fee of between 0.125% and 0.50% per year of the
unpaid balance of the loans. With regard to its servicing contracts with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, the Company can effectively retain a larger net service fee principally through its
methods of securitization. In general, the larger the net servicing fee retained, the smaller the net cash proceeds received upon securitization. Therefore, the decision to retain net service fees
above the contractual minimum amounts is based on the Company's assessment of the underlying economics as well as its capital requirements. As of December 31, 2007, the weighted-average service
fee, net of applicable guarantee fees, of the Company's portfolio of loans serviced for others was 0.35% per annum. 
        The
Company is generally entitled to retain the interest earned on funds held pending remittance (or ""float"") related to its collection of mortgagor principal, interest, tax and
insurance payments. The amount of float varies depending on the terms of the servicing contract and timing of receipt of payments from the mortgagors. The Company is generally entitled to various fees
collected that are contractually associated with the mortgages, such as late charges, mortgage prepayment penalties and collateral reconveyance fees. The Company generally has the right to solicit the
mortgagors for other products and services that it offers, such as insurance and second mortgage loans. 
        As
part of its loan servicing responsibilities, the Company is required to advance funds to cover delinquent scheduled principal and interest payments to security holders, as well as to
cover delinquent tax and insurance payments and other costs required to protect the investors' interest in the collateral

securing
the loans. The Company had $4.0 billion and $2.2 billion of such advances outstanding as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which amounts were included in other
assets at realizable value. 

 Borrower and Investor Custodial Accounts  

        As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company managed $19.2 billion and $23.3 billion, respectively, of borrower and investor custodial cash
accounts. These custodial accounts relate to the Company's mortgage servicing activities. Of these amounts, $12.6 billion and $15.7 billion, respectively, were deposited at the Bank, and
included in the Company's deposit liabilities as custodial deposit accounts. The remaining balances were deposited with other depository institutions and are not recorded on the Company's balance
sheets. 
Note 31Credit Losses Related to Securitized Loans  
        A significant amount of the mortgage loans originated by the Company were sold into the secondary mortgage market, primarily in the form of securities, and to a
lesser extent as whole loans. In connection with its loan sales, the Company has potential liability under the representations and warranties made to purchasers and insurers of the loans. In the event
of a breach of such representations and warranties, the Company may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans with the identified defects or indemnify the investor or insurer. In such cases,
the Company bears any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans. 
        Following
is a summary of the Company's liability for representations and warranties included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the periods presented:

        The
Company generally sells its Prime Mortgage Loans on a non-recourse basis, either in the form of securities or whole loans. In addition, it may sell a portion of its
Nonprime and Prime Home Equity Loans on a non-recourse basis in the form of whole loans. 

 Securitization  

        As described below, the degree to which we retain credit risk on loans that we sell through securitizations depends on the structure of the securitization. Our
Prime Mortgage Loans generally are securitized on a non-recourse basis, while Prime Home Equity and Nonprime Mortgage Loans generally are securitized with limited recourse for credit
losses. 

 Conforming Conventional Loans  

        We generally pool conforming conventional loans into MBS guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Subject to certain representations and warranties we make,
nearly all conventional loans securitized through Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac are sold on a non-recourse basis. The Company pays

COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 
guarantee
fees to these agencies to compensate them for their assumption of credit risk on securitized loans. 

 FHA-Insured and VA-Guaranteed Loans  

        FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed mortgage loans are generally pooled into MBS guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. The Company is insured against
foreclosure loss by the FHA or partially guaranteed against foreclosure loss by the VA. Fees charged by the FHA and VA for assuming such risks are paid directly by the borrower. The Company is exposed
to credit losses on defaulted VA loans to the extent that the partial guarantee provided by the VA is inadequate to cover the total credit losses incurred. The Company pays guarantee fees to Ginnie
Mae for Ginnie Mae's guarantee on its securities of timely payment of principal and interest. Ginnie Mae does not assume mortgage credit risk associated with the loans securitized under its program. 

 Non-conforming Conventional Loans  

        Non-conforming conventional prime mortgage loans are generally pooled into ""private-label"" (non-agency) MBS. Such securitizations involve
some form of credit enhancement such as senior/subordinated structures, including residual interests, overcollateralization or mortgage pool insurance. Securitizations that involve senior/subordinated
structures contain securities that assume varying levels of credit risk. Holders of subordinated securities are compensated for the credit risk assumed through a higher yield. When we sell the
subordinated securities created in connection with these securitizations we transfer the related credit risk subject to representations and warranties we make when the loans are securitized. When we
retain the subordinated securities, generally the residual interests, we are in the first loss position; however, the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the residual
securities. 
        In
some cases a portion of the retained residual interest is deposited into a net interest margin (""NIM"") security, which enables us to sell some of the future residual cash flows and
retain a smaller residual interest (""Back-end NIM Residual""). The holder of the Back-end NIM Residual is in the first loss position; however, the recourse for credit losses is
limited to the carrying value of the Back-end NIM residual. 

 Prime Home Equity Loans  

        Prime Home Equity Loans are generally pooled into private-label asset-backed securities. The Company generally securitizes these loans with limited recourse for
credit losses through retention of residual interests and other subordinated interests, such as transferor's interests. These securities
generally contain credit enhancement in the form of over-collateralization and insurance provided by a third-party surety. In some cases, the securitizations also contain mortgage pool
insurance or a limited corporate guarantee as a form of credit enhancement. As the holder of the residual interest Countrywide is in the first loss position. The Company is also exposed to additional
losses in home equity securitization transactions that involve insurance issued by third party sureties when losses exceed specified levels or duration. When this condition, known as rapid
amortization, occurs, the reimbursement Countrywide receives from the sale of additional draws on the home equity loans becomes subordinated to the claims of all other parties to the securitization,
including bondholders and the third party surety. This subordination has the effect of deferring reimbursement of the subsequent draws for an extended period and subjecting the subsequent draws to
absorbing credit losses.

COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 

 Nonprime Mortgage Loans  

        Nonprime Mortgage Loans generally are pooled into private-label asset-backed securities. The Company generally securitizes these loans with limited recourse for
credit losses through retention of residual interests. The holder of the residual interest is in the first loss position; however, the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of
the residual interest. In some cases, such limited recourse securitizations have contained lender paid mortgage insurance as a form of credit enhancement or a limited corporate guarantee from
Countrywide. The Company also has pooled a portion of Nonprime Mortgage Loans into securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae. In such cases, the Company has paid Fannie Mae a guarantee fee in exchange for
Fannie Mae assuming the credit risk of the underlying loans. 
        In
some cases a portion of the retained residual interest is deposited into a NIM security, which enables the Company to sell future residual cash flows and retain a smaller residual
interest. The holder of the Back-end NIM Residual is in the first loss position; however, the recourse for credit losses is limited to the carrying value of the Back-end NIM
residual. 
        The
Company's exposure to credit losses related to subordinated interests is limited to the assets' carrying values plus the value of additional draws we may be required to subordinate
if a rapid amortization event occurs in a securitization. We carry subordinated interests at their estimated fair values. The carrying values of our subordinated interests are as follows:

carrying values of our subordinated interests take into account our estimates of losses to be absorbed by the subordinated interests. 
        The
Company estimates its liability for impairment losses related to its future draw obligations and updates its estimate quarterly. The Company's provision for estimated losses arising
from future draw obligations is recorded as a component of impairment of retained interests. The accrued liability for impairment related to future expected funding obligations under a rapid
amortization event was $704.1 million as of December 31, 2007 and is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. The available credit lines
for the securitizations subject to or expected to be
subject to a future draw obligation are approximately $2.4 billion at December 31, 2007. However, due to the borrower's ability to pay down and redraw balances, a maximum obligation
cannot be defined.

Note 32Commitments and Contingencies  

 Legal Proceedings  

        Countrywide and certain subsidiaries are defendants in various legal proceedings involving matters generally incidental to their businesses. 
        In
addition, lawsuits alleging claims for derivative relief on behalf of the Company and securities, retirement plan, and other class action suits have recently been brought against
Countrywide, and certain of its current and former officers, directors and retirement plan administrators in either federal district court in Los Angeles, California, state superior court in Los
Angeles or state court in Delaware. Among other things, these lawsuits allege breach of state law fiduciary duties and violation of the federal securities laws and the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA""). These cases allege, among other things, that Countrywide did not disclose complete and accurate information about its mortgage lending practices and financial
condition. The shareholder derivative cases brought in federal court are brought on Countrywide's behalf and do not seek recovery of damages from the Company. Two consolidated cases alleging claims
for derivative relief on behalf of the Company are also pending in federal district court in Delaware, and alleges, among other things, that certain Company proxy filings contain incorrect statements
relating to the compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer. 
        Various
class action lawsuits relating to our proposed merger with Bank of America have been filed in the state courts of California and Delaware on behalf of a proposed class of
Countrywide shareholders against the Company, our directors and Bank of America. The class action lawsuits filed in state court in California have been removed to federal court in Los Angeles. These
lawsuits allege that the Company's directors breached their fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders by entering into the merger agreement with Bank of America and that Bank of America allegedly
aided and abetted those alleged breaches. Similarly, the plaintiffs in the shareholder derivative lawsuits brought in California state and federal court recently have amended their complaints to add
similar class action allegations relating to the proposed merger with Bank of America. 
        Although
Management believes it has meritorious defenses to each of these actions and intends to defend them vigorously, it is difficult to predict the resulting outcome of these
proceedings, particularly where investigations and proceedings are in early stages. Given the inherent difficulty in predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, Management cannot estimate losses or
ranges of losses for legal proceedings where there is only a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, such as those discussed in the two immediately preceding paragraphs. The Company
provides for potential losses that may arise out of legal proceedings to the extent such losses are deemed probable and can be estimated. Although the ultimate outcome of the Company's legal
proceedings discussed above cannot be 
F-102



 
COUNTRYWIDE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) 

ascertained
at this time, Management believes that any resulting liability will not materially affect its consolidated financial position; such resolution, however, could be material to its operating
results for a particular future period depending upon the outcome of the proceedings and the operating results for a particular period. This assessment is based, in part, on the existence of insurance
coverage. 

 Commitments to Buy or Sell Mortgage-Backed Securities and Other Derivatives Contracts  

        In connection with its open commitments to buy or sell MBS and other derivative contracts, the Company may be required to maintain margin deposits. With respect
to the MBS commitments, these requirements are generally greatest during periods of rapidly declining interest rates. With respect to other derivative contracts, margin requirements are generally
greatest during periods of increasing interest rates. Margin deposits placed by the Company at December 31, 2007, totaled $1.2 billion. 

 Lease Commitments  

        The Company leases office facilities under operating lease agreements extending through March 31, 2018. Future minimum annual rental commitments under
these non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows:

expense was $257.4 million, $231.5 million and $186.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. 

 Restrictions on Transfers of Funds  

        The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to regulatory and credit agreement restrictions which limit the subsidiaries' ability to transfer funds to
the Company through intercompany loans, advances or dividends. Pursuant to revolving credit facilities existing at December 31, 2007, the Company is required to maintain a minimum consolidated
net worth of $7.7 billion. 

 FHLB and FRB Stock  

        A subsidiary of the Bank is required to purchase stock in the FRB at an amount equal to 6% of its capital, one-half of which must be paid currently
with the balance due upon demand. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB and, therefore, is required to purchase FHLB stock. For the year ended December 31, 2007, the Bank was required to
purchase FHLB stock at an amount equal to 0.2% of its assets up to a maximum of $25.0 million, plus 4.5% of total outstanding FHLB advances, which totals $2.2 billion as of
December 31, 2007.

 Mortgage Reinsurance  

        The Company provides mortgage reinsurance on certain mortgage loans included in its servicing portfolio through contracts with several primary mortgage insurance
companies. Under these contracts, the Company provides aggregate excess loss coverage in a mezzanine layer in exchange for a portion of the pools' mortgage insurance premium. As of December 31,
2007, approximately $121.7 billion of mortgage loans in the Company's servicing portfolio are covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts. Management believes it has adequate valuation
allowances in place to cover anticipated losses. 

 Securities Underwriting  

        In connection with the Company's underwriting activities, the Company had commitments to purchase and sell new issues of securities aggregating
$1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2007.

Note 34Subsequent Events  
        On January 29, 2008, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared dividends of $1,812.50 per share on its Series B preferred stock and
$0.15 per common share. The preferred stock dividend is payable on February 15, 2008, and the common stock dividend is payable on February 29, 2008 to shareholders of record on
February 12, 2008. 
        As
discussed in Note 1Organization, and detailed in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on January 17, 2008, on January 11, 2008, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement with Bank of America.

PART I
 

ITEM 1.
BUSINESS

 
As used herein, Holdings
or the Registrant means Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., a Delaware
corporation, incorporated on December 29, 1983. Holdings and its subsidiaries
are collectively referred to as the Company, Lehman Brothers, the Firm, we,
us or our. Our executive offices are located at 745 Seventh Avenue, New
York, New York 10019, U.S.A., and our telephone number is 1-212-526-7000.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
Some of the statements contained or incorporated by
reference in this Report, including those relating to the Companys strategy
and other statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer
to future events or conditions or that include words such as expects, anticipates,
intends, plans, believes, estimates and similar expressions, are
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange
Act. These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only
managements expectations, estimates and projections regarding future events.
Similarly, these statements are not guarantees of future performance and
involve certain risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, which
may include, but are not limited to, the risk factors discussed in Item 1A
below and the factors listed in Managements Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of OperationsCertain Factors Affecting Results
of Operations in Part II, Item 7, of this Report.
 
As a global
investment bank, the nature of our business makes predicting future performance
difficult. Revenues and earnings may vary from quarter to quarter and from year
to year. Caution should be used when extrapolating historical results to future
periods. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, perhaps materially,
from the anticipated results and financial condition in any such
forward-looking statements and, accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date on which
they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

the London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Frankfurt, Paris, Milan, Singapore and Australian
stock exchanges.
 
Through our investment banking, trading, research, structuring
and distribution capabilities in equity and fixed income products, we continue
to build on our client-flow business model, which is based on our principal
focus of facilitating client transactions in all major global capital markets
products and services. We generate client-flow revenues from institutional,
corporate, government and high-net-worth clients by (i) advising on and
structuring transactions specifically suited to meet client needs; (ii) serving
as a market maker and/or intermediary in the global marketplace, including
having securities and other financial instrument products available to allow
clients to adjust their portfolios and risks across different market cycles; (iii)
originating loans for distribution to clients in the securitization or
principals market; (iv) providing investment management and advisory services;
and (v) acting as an underwriter to clients. As part of our client-flow
activities, we maintain inventory positions of varying amounts across a broad
range of financial instruments. In addition, we also take proprietary trading
and principal investment positions. The financial services industry is
significantly influenced by worldwide economic conditions as well as other
factors inherent in the global financial markets. As a result, revenues and
earnings may vary from quarter to quarter and from year to year. We believe our
client-flow orientation and the diversity of our business helps to mitigate
overall revenue volatility. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Report
for a discussion of certain material
risks to our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
 
We operate in three business segments (each of which
is described below): Capital Markets, Investment Banking and Investment
Management. Financial information concerning the Company for the fiscal years

Electronic commerce and
technology have changed and will continue to change the ways that securities
and other financial products are traded, distributed and settled. This creates

including investment banking firms, traditional and online securities brokerage
firms, mutual fund companies and other asset managers, investment advisers,
venture capital firms, certain commercial banks, insurance companies and others.
Our competitive ability depends on many factors, including our reputation, the
quality of our services and advice, product innovation, execution ability,
pricing, advertising and sales efforts and the talent of our personnel. See Part
I, Item 1A, Risk Factors  Competitive Environment, for a further discussion
of the competitive risks to which we are exposed.
 
Regulation
 
The financial services industry is subject to
extensive regulation in the various jurisdictions in which we do business.
Violation of applicable regulations can result in legal and/or administrative
proceedings, which may impose censures, fines, cease-and-desist orders,
prohibitions from engaging in, or limitations or conditions on, some of our
business activities, which could result in significant losses or reputational
damage. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable
regulations.
 
Currently,
U.S. and other international regulators are considering adopting a mutual
recognition regulatory scheme to lower the barriers for financial institutions
and markets seeking to conduct business in other jurisdictions. The objective
is to provide investors with greater access to foreign investment opportunities
while preserving important investor protection safeguards. Under mutual
recognition, non-U.S. financial intermediaries might be able to provide
services to U.S. investors without registering in the U.S. so long as those
intermediaries are supervised in an approved jurisdiction that offers
comparable regulatory oversight and reciprocity to U.S. firms. U.S. regulators
are also considering eliminating or loosening some of the restrictive
requirements under Rule 15a-6, which sets forth a process by which a non-U.S.
broker can access certain U.S. customers without full registration with the
SEC. Both mutual recognition and Rule 15a-6 reform could prompt changes to the
status of U.S. and non-U.S. entities through which the Firm conducts its
business, how and by whom the Firm is regulated internationally, and how
certain cross-border transactions are structured.
 
U.S. Regulation. Holdings and its subsidiaries are subject to
group-wide supervision and examination by the SEC as a Consolidated Supervised
Entity (CSE). See Capital Requirements below and Managements Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsAccounting and
Regulatory DevelopmentsBasel II
in Part II, Item 7, of this Report.
 
Lehman Brothers Inc. (LBI), Neuberger Berman, LLC
(NB LLC) and Neuberger Berman Management Inc. (NBMI) are registered with
the SEC as broker-dealers; Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. (LB OTC) is
registered with the SEC as an OTC derivatives dealer; and LBI, NB LLC, NBMI,
Lehman Brothers Asset Management LLC (LBAM), and certain other of our
subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as investment advisers. As such, these
entities are subject to regulation by the SEC and by self-regulatory
organizations, principally FINRA (which has been designated by the SEC as 
 
-10-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
LBIs, NB LLCs and NBMIs primary regulator),
national securities exchanges such as the NYSE and the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board, among others. Securities firms are also subject to regulation
by state securities administrators in those states in which they conduct
business. Various subsidiaries are registered as broker-dealers in all 50
states, the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
 
Broker-dealers are subject to regulations, including
those contained in the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, and rules promulgated thereunder, that cover all aspects of the
securities business, including sales practices, market making and trading among
broker-dealers, publication of research, margin lending, use and safekeeping of
clients funds and securities, capital structure, recordkeeping and the conduct
of directors, officers and employees.
 
Registered investment advisers are subject to
regulations under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Such requirements relate
to, among other things, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure
requirements, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an
adviser and advisory clients, as well as general anti-fraud prohibitions.
 
Certain investment funds that we manage are
registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those
funds and the Lehman Brothers entities that serve as the funds investment
advisers are subject to that act and the rules thereunder, which, among other
things, regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and
its investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions
and joint transactions.
 
LBI and NB LLC are also registered with the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) as futures commission merchants, and NB
LLC, LBAM and other subsidiaries are registered as commodity pool operators
and/or commodity trading advisers. These entities are subject to regulation by
the CFTC and various domestic boards of trade and other commodity exchanges.
Our U.S. commodity futures and options business is also regulated by the
National Futures Association, a not-for-profit membership corporation that has
been designated as a registered futures association by the CFTC.
 
LB Bank, a federally chartered savings bank
incorporated under the laws of the United States of America, is regulated by
the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(FDIC). LB Commercial Bank is subject to regulation by the FDIC and the Utah
Commissioner of Financial Institutions. Lehman Brothers Trust Company N.A.,
which holds a national bank charter, is regulated by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency of the United States. Lehman Brothers Trust Company
of Delaware, a non-depository limited purpose Delaware trust company, is
subject to oversight by the State Bank Commissioner of the State of Delaware.
These bodies regulate such matters as policies and procedures on conflicts of
interest, account administration and overall governance and supervisory
procedures.
 
Lehman Brothers Commodity
Services Inc. (LBCS) is authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to sell wholesale physical power at market-based rates. As
a FERC-authorized power marketer, LBCS is subject to regulation under the
Federal Power Act and FERC regulations.
 
Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to state insurance
regulation in the states in which they are domiciled and in the other states in
which they are licensed.
 
Non-U.S.
Regulation. We do business in the international fixed
income and equity markets and undertake international investment banking and
investment management activities, principally through our regional headquarters
in London and Tokyo. Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (LB Europe) is an
authorized investment firm in the United Kingdom and is a member of the London,
Frankfurt, Paris and Milan exchanges, among others. The U.K. Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000 (the FSMA) and rules promulgated thereunder govern all
aspects of the United Kingdom investment business, including regulatory
capital, sales, research and trading practices, use and safekeeping of client
funds and securities, record keeping, margin practices and procedures, approval
standards for individuals, periodic reporting and settlement procedures.
Pursuant to the FSMA, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations
promulgated and administered by the U.K.s Financial Services Authority
(FSA).
 
The investment
services that are subject to oversight by the FSA and other European regulators
are regulated in accordance with European Union (EU) directives requiring,
among other things, customer protection requirements and conduct of business
rules. These standards, requirements and rules are similarly implemented, under
the same directives, throughout the EU and are broadly comparable in scope and
purpose to the customer protection requirements imposed under the SEC and CFTC
rules. Some EU directives also permit local regulation in each jurisdiction,
including those in which we operate, to be more restrictive than the
requirements of such directives.
 
The EU Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), a major piece of legislation that
updates and expands the current framework for regulating exchanges,
multilateral trading facilities and investment firms on a pan-European basis,
was implemented in the U.K. and most other EU member states on November 1,
2007. MiFID facilitates cross-border 
 
-11-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
business by
investment firms by generally establishing the regulatory regime of the member
state in which an investment firm has its registered or head office as
controlling the investment business of that firm. Once a firm has been authorized by its home
member state, it will be able to use the MiFID passport to provide services to
customers in other EU member states, which will be regulated by the home member
state (whereas previously a service was regulated by the EU member state in
which the service was provided). MiFID imposes a new set of
organizational and conduct of business requirements on investment firms.
Ongoing efforts by EU member countries to adopt national laws and regulations
under MiFID could subject the Firm to new regulatory requirements in 2008.
 
Various Lehman Brothers subsidiaries are regulated by the banking and
regulatory authorities of the other European countries in which we operate,
including the German Federal Supervisory Authority for the Financial Service
Industry (BaFin), the Commission Bancaire and other agencies in France, the
Banca dItalia and the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (CONSOB)
in Italy, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier in Luxembourg and
the Swiss Federal Banking Commission, as well as by the European securities,
derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members. The rules and
requirements of these European regulators and exchanges are broadly comparable
to the rules and the requirements of the U.S. regulators and exchanges.
 
Lehman Brothers Japan Inc. (LB Japan) is a registered securities
company in Japan and a member of the Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc., the Osaka Securities
Exchange Co., Ltd., the Jasdaq Securities Exchange Inc., the Tokyo
Financial  Exchange Inc. and the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange and, as such, is regulated by the Financial Services Agency,
the Securities Exchange Surveillance Commission, the Japan Securities Dealers
Association, the Financial Futures Association of Japan, the Tokyo Metropolitan
Government and those exchanges.
 
Other Lehman
Brothers subsidiaries in Asia are regulated by the Securities and Futures
Commission in Hong Kong, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the China
Securities Regulatory Commission, the Korean Financial Supervisory Service, the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Securities and Exchange
Board of India and the Reserve Bank of India, as well as by the Asian
securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges of which they are members.
The rules and requirements of these Asian regulators and exchanges are broadly
comparable to the rules and the requirements of the U.S. regulators and
exchanges.
 
In the Americas, LBI and certain other subsidiaries
are regulated by the Ontario Securities Commission in Canada, and certain of
our Bermuda-based insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the Bermuda Monetary
Authority.
 
LBI, LB Europe, LB Japan and many of our other subsidiaries
are also subject to regulation by securities, banking and finance regulatory
authorities, securities, derivatives and commodities exchanges and other
self-regulatory organizations in numerous other countries in which we do
business.
 
Research.
The research areas of investment banks have been and
remain the subject of regulatory scrutiny. The SEC, NYSE and NASD (now FINRA)
have adopted rules imposing restrictions on the interaction between equity
research analysts and investment banking personnel at member securities firms.
Various nonU.S. jurisdictions have imposed both substantive and
disclosure-based requirements with respect to research, and continue to
consider additional regulation. In addition, we are a party to a settlement
with certain federal and state securities regulators and self-regulatory
organizations that imposes restrictions on the interaction between research and
investment banking departments and requires us to fund the provision of
independent research to our clients.
 
Mortgage Lending. We originate, purchase and
securitize commercial and residential mortgage loans through LB Bank, Bankhaus
and other subsidiaries in the U.S., Europe and Asia, and we are subject to an
extensive body of U.S. federal and state mortgage laws and regulations, as well
as laws and regulations in other countries, including the U.K., the
Netherlands, Japan and South Korea. In recent years, individual cities and
counties in the U.S. have begun to enact laws that restrict non-prime loan
origination activities. The U.S. federal government is also considering
legislative and regulatory proposals in this regard. In 2006, U.S. federal bank
regulators issued interagency guidance applicable to federally chartered
lenders such as LB Bank covering certain residential mortgage loan products,
and are considering further proposals that cover topics related to loan terms
and underwriting standards, risk management practices and consumer protection
issues. It remains unclear how all these initiatives will be interpreted, what
effect it will have on our business and whether it will change the overall
competitive landscape in the mortgage industry.
 
In addition, the SEC and
banking regulators are examining the disruption in the subprime mortgage market
that began in the summer of 2007. Their efforts have focused on a wide range of
issues, including the origination and securitization of mortgages, the sale of
collateralized debt obligations and other securities backed by those mortgages,
and valuation and pricing of those securities internally and for customers. In
addition to reviewing the sales of subprime-backed securities to customers,
regulators have expressed interest in reviewing the proprietary positions taken
by firms who have underwritten them, including broker-dealer exposure to
subprime-backed securities, and capital treatment and

LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
financial reporting,
including off-balance sheet vehicles with subprime mortgage exposure. As the
regulatory efforts are in their early stages, it is unclear what, if any,
action will be taken.
 
Hedge
Fund Activities. In recent years, high-profile hedge fund
failures and concerns about hedge fund transparency and systemic risk have
brought increased regulatory attention to hedge funds as well as to their
counterparties and other entities that service them. In addition to Lehman
Brothers proprietary funds, the Firm provides services and is a counterparty
to unaffiliated hedge funds and is subject to regulation concerning all of
these activities. We also have investments in a number of hedge fund managers.
Because most hedge funds are not directly regulated, financial regulators in
the U.S. and abroad are increasingly focused on counterparty credit risk management
practices of other financial institutions as the optimal way to control hedge
fund leverage and limit systemic vulnerabilities.
 
The U.S. Congress has
been examining the adequacy of the existing regulatory structure and is
considering whether to introduce legislation to require hedge funds to register
with the SEC. The Presidents Working Group and central bankers abroad are
working on a set of best practices for hedge funds. In addition to proposing
new regulations extending anti-fraud protection to hedge fund investors and
raising the eligibility threshold for investing in hedge funds, the SEC has
created several working groups that focus specifically on hedge fund
practices, including identifying and managing conflicts of interest, preventing
and detecting insider trading, and valuation of hedge fund assets.
 
Protection
of Client Information. Many aspects of our business are
subject to increasingly comprehensive legal and regulatory requirements
concerning the use, safeguarding and disposal of certain client information,
including those adopted pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, the
Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 and a number of state data
protection laws in the U.S., the EU Data Protection and Telecommunications Privacy
Directives and member state implementations, and various laws in Asia,
including the Japanese Personal Information Protection Law and the Hong Kong
Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance. We monitor these matters closely and adopt
policies and procedures designed to comply with such requirements.
 
Anti-Money
Laundering. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and various laws
and regulations in the U.K, EU, Japan and other jurisdictions contain
anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism requirements that mandate the implementation
of various regulations applicable to financial services companies, including
requirements for verifying client identity at account opening, conducting
enhanced due diligence, monitoring client transactions and reporting suspicious
activities, staff training and awareness, record keeping and making use of
international findings. These laws and regulations seek to promote cooperation
among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement in identifying
parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. We have
established policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to
comply with these laws and regulations.
 
Judicial,
Regulatory and Arbitration Proceedings. We are involved
in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning
matters arising in connection with the conduct of our business. See Part I,
Item 3, Legal Proceedings, in this Report for information about certain
pending proceedings.
 
Capital
Requirements
 
LBI, LB OTC, NB LLC, NBMI, LB Europe, LB Japan, LB
Bank, LB Commercial Bank, Bankhaus and other regulated subsidiaries of Holdings
are subject to various capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the
regulatory, banking and exchange authorities of the countries in which they
operate. In addition, our AAA rated derivatives subsidiaries (Lehman Brothers
Financial Products Inc. and Lehman Brothers Derivative Products Inc.) are
subject to capital targets established by various ratings agencies. The
regulatory rules referred to above, and certain covenants contained in various
debt agreements, may restrict Holdings ability to withdraw capital from
certain subsidiaries, which in turn could limit its ability to commit capital
to other businesses, meet obligations or pay dividends to shareholders. Further
information about these requirements and restrictions is contained in Managements
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
OperationsLiquidity, Funding and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7, of
this Report and in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,
Item 8, of this Report.
 
The SEC has
granted us permission to operate under its CSE rule, a voluntary framework for
comprehensive, group-wide risk management procedures and consolidated supervision
of certain financial services holding companies. The rule allows LBI to use an
alternative method, based on internal models, to calculate net capital charges
for market and derivative-related credit risk. Under this rule, Lehman Brothers
is subject to group-wide supervision and examination by the SEC and is subject
to minimum capital requirements on a consolidated basis consistent with the
Basel II Accord published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The
CSE Rules are designed to minimize the duplicative regulatory requirements on
U.S. securities firms resulting from the EU Directive (2002/87/EC) concerning
the supplementary supervision of financial conglomerates active in the EU. This
Directive permits non-EU financial groups that conduct business through
regulated financial entities in the EU to demonstrate that they are subject to
equivalent 
 
-13-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
consolidated
supervision at the ultimate holding company level; the FSA has determined that
the SEC undertakes equivalent consolidated supervision for Lehman Brothers. See
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
OperationsAccounting and Regulatory DevelopmentsBasel II in Part II, Item 7,
of this Report for more information.
 
Client Protection
 
LBI and NB LLC are
members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). Clients of
LBI and NB LLC are protected by SIPC against some losses. SIPC provides
protection against lost, stolen or missing securities (except loss in value due
to a rise or fall in market prices) for clients in the event of the failure of
the broker-dealer. Accounts are protected up to $500,000 per client with a
limit of $100,000 for cash balances. In addition to being members of SIPC, LBI
and NB LLC carry excess SIPC protection, which increases each clients
protection up to the net equity of the account, subject to terms and conditions
similar to SIPC. Like SIPC, the excess coverage does not apply to loss in value
due to a rise or fall in market prices. Certain of our non-U.S. broker-dealer
subsidiaries participate in programs similar to SIPC in certain jurisdictions.
 
Deposits in LB
Bank and LB Commercial Bank are insured by the FDIC, subject to applicable
limits per depositor. Bankhaus participates in the German Depositors Protection
Fund, which insures deposits from non-bank clients, with applicable limits per
depositor.
 
Insurance
 
We maintain insurance
coverage in types and amounts and with deductibles that management believes are
customary for companies of similar size and engaged in similar businesses.
However, the insurance market is volatile, and there can be no assurance that
any particular coverage will be available in the future on terms acceptable to
us.
 
Employees
 
As of November 30, 2007,
Lehman Brothers employed approximately 28,600 persons. We consider our
relationship with our employees to be good.
 

ITEM 1A.
RISK FACTORS

 
You
should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information
set forth in this Report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and
the Notes thereto. If any of
the events or developments described below were actually to occur, our
business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be
materially adversely affected.
 
Market Risk
 
As a global investment
bank, risk is an inherent part of our business. Our businesses are materially
affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions
generally around the world. A favorable business environment is generally
characterized by, among other factors, high global gross
domestic product growth, stable geopolitical conditions, transparent and
efficient capital markets, liquid markets with active investors, low inflation,
high business and consumer confidence and strong business earnings.
Slowing growth, contraction of credit, increasing energy prices, declines in
business or investor confidence or risk tolerance, increases in inflation,
higher unemployment, outbreaks of hostilities or other geopolitical
instability, corporate, political or other scandals that reduce investor
confidence in capital markets and natural disasters, among other things, can
affect the global financial markets. In addition, economic or political
pressures in a country or region may cause local market disruptions and
currency devaluations, which may also affect markets generally. In the event of
changes in market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates,
equity, fixed income, commodity or real estate valuations, liquidity,
availability of credit or volatility, our businesses could be adversely
affected in many ways, including those described below. See Part II, Item 7, Managements
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRisk
ManagementMarket Risk for a further discussion of the market risks to which
we are exposed.
 
-14-





 
LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
Our
Client-Flow Revenues May Decline in Adverse Market Conditions. Recently, the residential real estate market in the U.S.
has experienced a significant downturn due to declining real estate values,
substantially reducing mortgage loan originations and securitizations, and
precipitating more generalized credit market dislocations and a significant
contraction in available liquidity globally, which negatively impacted our revenues. These factors have
continued into the beginning of fiscal 2008 and, combined with rising oil
prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment,
have precipitated an economic slowdown and fears of a possible recession.
Further declines in real estate values in the U.S. or elsewhere and continuing
credit and liquidity concerns could further reduce our level of mortgage loan
originations and securitizations and increase our mortgage inventory while
adversely affecting its value. In addition, continued or further credit market
dislocations or sustained market downturns may reduce client flow revenues and
adversely affect the value of our inventory in other businesses.
 
Changes in interest
rates, and in particular long-term rates, especially if such changes are rapid,
may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses. Rising
interest rates may cause a decline in our mortgage origination and
securitization businesses in particular, as the volume of our origination and
securitization activity may decline.
 
Our Investment Banking
revenues, in the form of financial advisory and debt and equity underwriting
fees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which
we participate and therefore were adversely affected in the latter half of 2007
by the mortgage and credit market dislocations, and may be further impacted by
continued or further credit market dislocations or sustained market downturns.
 
Sustained market
downturns or continued or further credit market dislocations and liquidity
issues would also likely lead to a decline in the volume of capital market
transactions that we execute for our clients and, therefore, to a decline in
the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads earned from the trades we
execute for our clients. In addition, because the fees that we charge for
managing our clients portfolios are in many cases based on the value of those
portfolios, a market downturn that reduces the value of our clients portfolios
would reduce the revenues we receive from our asset management business.
Heightened risk aversion among investors may cause them to shift their trading
activity to higher quality and more liquid products, which are generally
somewhat less profitable for us.
 
Even in the absence of a
market downturn, below-market investment performance by our fund and portfolio
managers could reduce Investment Management revenues and assets under
management and result in reputational damage that might make it more difficult
to attract new investors.
 
We May
Incur Losses Due to Fluctuations in Market Rates, Prices and Volatility. Market risk is inherent in our client-driven market-making
transactions and proprietary trading and principal investment activities in
equity and fixed income securities, commodities, currencies and derivatives and
our mortgage and loan origination and syndication activities. Fluctuations in
market rates, prices and volatility, especially if the changes are rapid and
without warning, can adversely affect the market value of our long or short
inventory and proprietary and principal positions and, to the extent that such
positions are not adequately hedged, cause the Firm to incur losses. To the
extent that we hold long inventory positions, a downturn in the market could
result in losses from a decline in the value of those positions. On the other
hand, to the extent that we have sold inventory short, an upturn in those
markets could expose us to losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by
acquiring assets in a rising market. The adverse conditions in the U.S. housing
market, dislocations in the credit markets and corrections in certain
asset-backed security market segments resulted in substantial valuation
reductions in the past fiscal year, most significantly on mortgage- and real
estate-related positions and lending obligations. Market credit spreads have recently gone from historically tight to
historically wide levels, and a further widening of credit spreads or worsening
of credit market dislocations or sustained market downturns could have additional
negative effects on the value of our inventory.
 
In our market-making and
specialist transactions, we maintain substantial inventory positions from time
to time, acting as a financial intermediary for our clients, and we hold
inventory positions in the normal course of business to allow clients to
rebalance their portfolios and diversify risks across market cycles. Current
NYSE rules generally require our specialist business to maintain orderly
markets in the securities for which it is a specialist. Specialists are
obligated to take positions in their issues counter to the direction of the
market in order to minimize short-term imbalances in the market, involving risk
of loss during periods of market fluctuation and volatility.
 
In our mortgage and loan
origination and securitization businesses, we are also subject to risks from
decreasing interest rates. Most residential mortgages and consumer loans
provide that the borrower may repay them early. Borrowers often exercise this
right when interest rates decline. As prepayments increase, the value of
mortgages and other loans with prepayment features held in inventory prior to
securitization generally will decrease, and to the extent that prepayment risk
has not been hedged, prepayments may result in a loss.
 
We also maintain long and
short positions through our other proprietary trading activities and make
principal 
 
-15-





 
LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
investments (such as in
real estate and real estate-related products and private equity), which are
also subject to market risks. The value of these positions can be adversely
affected by changes in market rates, prices and volatility. We have increased
our proprietary trading and principal investing activities and expect to
continue to do so, which increases our exposure to market risk.
 
On the other hand our
client-flow and proprietary trading businesses generally depend on market
volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and a decline in volatility
may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect the results of these
businesses.
 
Holding
Large and Concentrated Positions May Expose Us to Losses. Concentration of risk may reduce revenues or result in
losses in our market-making, specialist, block trading, underwriting,
proprietary trading, principal investment and lending businesses in the event
of unfavorable market movements even when economic and market conditions are
generally favorable for others in the industry. We have committed substantial
amounts of capital to these businesses, which often require us to take large
positions in the securities of, or make large loans to, a particular issuer or
issuers in a particular industry, country or region. Moreover, the trend in all
major capital markets is towards larger and more frequent commitments of
capital in many of these activities, and we expect this trend to continue. For
example, large positions of securities are increasingly being sold in block
trades rather than on a marketed basis, which could increase the risk that we
may be unable to resell the securities at favorable prices. While our
activities expose us to many different counterparties, we routinely execute a
high volume of transactions with counterparties in the financial services
industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment funds and
other institutional clients, resulting in significant credit concentration with
respect to this industry. In the ordinary course of business, we may also be
subject to a concentration of credit risk to a particular counterparty,
borrower or issuer. Concentration of risk will increase as we expand our
proprietary trading and principal investing activities or commit additional
capital to facilitate client-driven business.
 
Market
Risk May Increase the Other Risks That We Face. In addition to the potentially adverse effects on our
businesses described above, market risk could exacerbate other risks that we
face. For example, if we were to incur substantial market risk losses, our need
for liquidity could rise significantly, while our access to liquidity could be
impaired. In addition, in conjunction with a market downturn, our clients and
counterparties could incur substantial losses of their own, thereby weakening
their financial condition and increasing our credit risk exposure to them.
 
Credit Risk
 
We May Incur
Losses Associated with Our Credit Exposures. Credit risk
represents the possibility a counterparty or an issuer of securities or other
financial instruments we hold or a borrower of funds from us will be unable to
honor its contractual obligations to us. These parties may default on their
obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or
other reasons. Default risk may also arise from events or circumstances that
are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. Credit risk may arise, for
example, from holding securities of third parties; entering into swap or other
derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make payments
to us; executing securities, futures, currency or commodity trades that fail to
settle at the required time due to non-delivery by the counterparty or systems
failure by clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial
intermediaries; and extending credit to our clients through bridge or margin
loans or other arrangements. As a clearing member firm, we finance our client
positions, and we could be held responsible for the defaults or misconduct of
our clients. See Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRisk ManagementCredit Risk for
a further discussion of the credit risks to which we are exposed. Our principal
focus has been acting as an intermediary of credit. In recent years, we have
expanded our activities associated with providing our clients access to credit
and liquidity and have also expanded our swaps and derivatives businesses. The
amount and duration of our credit exposures have been increasing, as has the
diversity of the entities to which we have credit exposures. The extension and
pricing of credit is subject to competitive pressure. In addition, corporate
clients sometimes seek to require credit commitments from us in connection with
investment banking and other assignments. Further, the recent widening of credit spreads and dislocations
in the credit markets have in some cases made it more difficult to syndicate
credit commitments to investors, and further widening of credit spreads or worsening of these dislocations
could increase these difficulties, resulting in increased credit exposures.
 
Defaults
by Another Large Financial Institution Could Adversely Affect Financial Markets
Generally. The commercial
soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a
result of credit, trading, clearing or other relationships between the
institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default by, one institution
could lead to significant market-wide liquidity problems, losses or defaults by
other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as systemic risk and may
adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, clearing
houses, banks, securities firms and exchanges, with which we interact on a
daily basis, and therefore could adversely affect Lehman Brothers.
 
-16-





 
LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
Liquidity Risk
 
Liquidity, that is ready
access to funds, is essential to our businesses. Financial institutions rely on
external borrowings for the vast majority of their funding, and failures in our
industry are typically the result of insufficient liquidity.
 
An
Inability to Access the Debt Markets Could Impair Our Liquidity.
We maintain a liquidity pool available to Holdings that is intended to cover
all expected cash outflows for one year in a stressed liquidity environment,
which assumes, among other things, that during that year we cannot issue
unsecured debt. See Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity, Funding and Capital
ResourcesLiquidity for a
discussion of our liquidity needs and liquidity management.
 
To
the extent that a liquidity event lasts for more than one year, or our
expectations concerning the market conditions that exist during a liquidity
event, or our access to funds, prove to be inaccurate (e.g., the level of secured financing haircuts
(the difference between the market and pledge value of the assets) required to
fund our assets in a stressed market event is greater than expected, or the
amount of drawdowns under our commitments to extend credit in a stressed market
environment exceeds our expectations), our ability to repay maturing
indebtedness and fund operations could be significantly impaired. Even
within the one-year time frame contemplated by our liquidity pool, we depend on
continuous access to secured financing in the repurchase and securities lending
markets, which could be impaired by factors that are not specific to Lehman
Brothers, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets.
 
Structured
Instruments May Have Limited Liquidity. The financial instruments that we hold and the
contracts to which we are a party are increasingly complex, as we employ
structured products to benefit our clients and ourselves, and these complex
structured products often do not have readily available markets to access in
times of liquidity stress. The growth of our proprietary investing activities
may lead to situations where the holdings of structured instruments represent a
significant portion of specific markets, which could restrict liquidity for our
positions. Further, our ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market
participants are seeking to sell similar assets at the same time.
 
We Are
a Holding Company and Are Dependent on Our Subsidiaries for Funds.
Since Holdings is primarily a holding company, our cash flow and consequent
ability to pay dividends and satisfy our obligations under securities we issue
are dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of
those earnings as dividends or loans or other payments by those subsidiaries to
Holdings. Several of our principal subsidiaries are subject to various capital
adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory, banking and exchange
authorities of the countries in which they operate and/or to capital targets
established by various ratings agencies. These regulatory rules, and certain
covenants contained in various debt agreements, may restrict our ability to withdraw
capital from our subsidiaries by dividends, loans or other payments. Further
information about these requirements and restrictions is set forth in Note 15
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Report.
Additionally, our ability to participate as an equity holder in any
distribution of assets of any subsidiary upon liquidation is generally
subordinate to the claims of creditors of the subsidiary.
 
Credit Ratings
 
Our borrowing costs and
our access to the debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit
ratings. A reduction in our long- or short-term credit ratings could increase
our borrowing costs, limit our access to the capital markets and trigger
additional collateral requirements in derivative contracts and other secured
funding arrangements. Credit ratings are also important to us when competing in
certain markets, such as longer-term over-the-counter derivatives. Therefore, a
substantial reduction in our credit ratings would reduce our earnings and
adversely affect our liquidity and competitive position. See Part II, Item 7, Managements
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
OperationsLiquidity, Funding and Capital ResourcesLiquidity and Credit
Ratings for additional information concerning our credit ratings.
 
Risks Relating to Use of
Estimates and Valuations
 
We make various estimates
that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Broadly, those estimates are used
in measuring fair value of certain financial instruments, accounting for
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, establishing provisions for
potential losses that may arise from litigation, regulatory proceedings and tax
examinations, assessing our ability to realize deferred taxes and valuing
equity-based compensation awards. Estimates are based on available information
and judgment. Therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates and
that difference could have a material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.
 
Financial instruments and other inventory positions owned (including
commitments and guarantees, but excluding real estate held for sale), and
financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased,
are presented at fair value, with realized and unrealized gains or losses
reflected in Principal transactions in our Consolidated Statement of

LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
Income. We account for real estate held for sale at the lower of its
carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. In addition, certain long and
short-term borrowing obligations, principally hybrid financial instruments, and
certain deposits at U.S. banks, are reflected at fair value. Fair value is
defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in a current
transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. A liabilitys fair value is
defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new
obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the
creditor. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or
parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices
or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation
techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree
of which is dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market
and the instruments complexity. In particular, certain mortgage and
asset-backed securities, certain corporate debt, certain private equity
investments, certain commitments and guarantees and certain derivatives have no
direct observable levels, and their valuations require significant estimation
and judgment and therefore are subject to significant subjectivity. Reliance on
estimation and judgment increases in adverse market conditions with decreased
liquidity, such as those experienced recently.
 
See Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates
and Notes 1 and 3 through 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II,
Item 8, of this Report for additional information concerning our use of
estimates and valuation methodologies.
 
Risks Relating to Off-Balance Sheet Entities
 
In the normal
course of our business, we enter into various transactions with special purpose
entities (SPEs). We do not consolidate certain SPEs in which we do not have a
controlling financial interest as defined under applicable accounting
standards. When we do not consolidate an entity, we either present our
investment in the entity at fair value or apply the equity method of
accounting. The assessment of whether the accounting criteria for consolidation
are met requires management to exercise significant judgment. A determination
of whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity, and therefore
our assessment of consolidation of that entity, is initially made at the time
we become involved with the entity. If certain events occur that require us to
re-assess our initial determination of non-consolidation or if our judgment of
non-consolidation is in error, we could be required to consolidate the assets
and liabilities of an SPE onto our consolidated balance sheet and recognize its
future gains or losses in our consolidated statement of income. Further,
existing accounting standards may be changed, or interpretations of those
standards may change, in the future in a manner that requires or increases the
risk of consolidation of some SPEs. Consolidation could affect the size of our
consolidated balance sheet and related funding requirements, our financial and
regulatory capital ratios and, if the SPEs assets include unrealized losses,
could require us to recognize those losses.
 
In addition, we
have various commitments to and obligations associated with SPEs, including
liquidity commitments and funded loans to certain conduits and other SPEs,
limited downside protection guarantees to investors in certain SPEs,
obligations as a general partner and investment advisor to private equity and
other investment partnerships, indemnification obligations to investors in
certain securitization vehicles we sponsor with respect to customary
representations and warranties we make about the assets of SPEs, proprietary
investments and retained interests in various SPEs and others. For additional
information about our consolidation accounting policies and transactions with
SPEs, and events that may require us to re-assess our determination of
non-consolidation, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of OperationsCritical Accounting Policies and
EstimatesConsolidation Policies and Off-Balance-Sheet ArrangementsSpecial
Purpose Entities in Part II, Item 7, and Notes 1, 6 and 9 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, of this Report.
 
Operational Risk
 
Operational
Risks May Disrupt Our Businesses, Result in Losses or Reputational Damage or
Limit Our Growth. We face operational risk arising from
errors made in the execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions or
from transactions not being properly recorded, evaluated or accounted for.
Derivative contracts are not always confirmed by the counterparties on a timely
basis; while the transaction remains unconfirmed, we are subject to heightened
credit and operational risk and in the event of a default may find it more
difficult to enforce the contract. Our businesses are highly dependent on our
ability to process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across
numerous and diverse markets in many currencies and the transactions we process
have become increasingly complex. Consequently, we rely heavily on our
financial, accounting and other data processing systems. If any of these
systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial
loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory
intervention or reputational damage. The inability of our systems to
accommodate an increasing volume of complex transactions could also constrain
our ability to expand our businesses. In recent years, we have substantially
upgraded and expanded the capabilities of our data processing systems and other
operating technology, and we expect that we will need to continue to upgrade
and expand in the future to avoid disruption of, or constraints on, our
operations.
 
-18-





 
LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
Our businesses and
operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of
confidential and other information, and, increasingly, on the internet. We
routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary
information by email and other electronic means. We have made available to
clients and counterparties certain secure transmission capabilities; however,
our clients and counterparties do not always choose to avail themselves of
these capabilities. We take extensive protective measures for our computer
systems, internet sites, software and networks to protect against
vulnerabilities to unauthorized access, computer viruses, denial of service
attacks or other events that could have a security or business impact. If,
nevertheless, such events should occur, they could result in significant losses
or reputational damage. We are exposed to similar risks arising from the
interception of personal, confidential or proprietary information sent to or
received from, or the misuse or mishandling thereof by, vendors, service
providers and other third parties who may receive such information from us, and
our ongoing efforts to improve security over email and encrypted file
transfers and to ensure that these third parties have appropriate
controls in place may not be successful.
 
We also face the risk of
operational or business failure of any of the clearing agents or other
financial intermediaries or data providers we use, and as our interconnectivity
with our clients grows, we face higher levels of operational risk that could
adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients and
manage our exposure to risk.
 
When we originate or
purchase residential mortgage loans, we rely heavily upon information supplied
by third parties, including the information contained in the loan application,
property appraisal, title information and employment and income documentation.
If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented,
whether by the loan applicant, the mortgage broker, another third party or one
of our employees, and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan
funding, the value of the loan may be significantly lower than expected and/or
be unsaleable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the
misrepresentation. While relevant laws may not explicitly hold the originating
lenders responsible for the legal violations of mortgage brokers, increasingly
federal and state agencies have sought to impose such assignee liability.
 
In addition, despite the
contingency plans we have in place, our ability to conduct business may be
adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our
businesses and the communities in which we are located. This may include a
disruption involving electrical systems, communications, transportation or
other services used by Lehman Brothers or third parties with which we conduct
business, terrorist activities or disease pandemics. See Managements
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRisk
Management in Part II, Item 7, of this Report for a description of our Risk
Management infrastructure and procedures.
 
Acquisitions or
Joint Ventures Could Present Unforeseen Integration Obstacles or Costs. Acquisitions and joint ventures involve a
number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges,
including difficulty with integrating personnel and financial and other
systems, hiring additional management and other critical personnel and
increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations. In
addition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition, and
we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business.
 
Legal, Regulatory and
Reputational Risk
 
We face the risk of
litigation and intervention by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in
which we conduct our businesses. Among other things, we could be subjected to
judgments or fines, be prohibited from engaging in some of our business
activities or be subjected to limitations or conditions on our business
activities, all of which could result in significant losses or reputational
damage.
 
We Face
Significant Litigation Risks in Our Businesses. The
volume of litigation against financial services firms and the amount of damages
claimed have increased over the past several years. We are exposed to potential
liability as an underwriter under securities or other laws for materially false
or misleading statements made in connection with securities and other
transactions, potential liability for the fairness opinions and other advice
we provide to participants in corporate transactions and disputes over the
terms, conditions and risks of trading arrangements. We also face the
possibility that counterparties will claim that we improperly failed to tell
them of the risks or that they were not authorized or permitted to enter into
these transactions with us and that their obligations to Lehman Brothers are
not enforceable. In our Investment Management segment, we are exposed to claims
against us for recommending investments that are not consistent with a clients
investment objectives or engaging in unauthorized or excessive trading. The
downturn in the mortgage and mortgage-backed securities markets may result in
increased claims of this type, and during a prolonged market downturn, we would
expect these claims to further increase. We are also subject to claims arising
from disputes with employees for alleged discrimination or harassment, among
other things. These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify, and
their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of
time. We incur significant legal expenses every year in defending against
litigation, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. See Part I, Item
3, Legal Proceedings for a discussion of some of the legal and regulatory

LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
matters in which we are
currently involved.
 
Extensive
Regulation of Our Businesses Limits Our Activities and May Subject Us to Significant
Penalties. Lehman
Brothers, as a participant in the financial services industry, is subject to
extensive regulation under both federal and state laws in the U.S. and under
the laws of the many global jurisdictions in which we do business. We are also
regulated by a number of self-regulatory organizations. The industry has
experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators, including the SEC,
FINRA and state attorneys general. Over the last several years, penalties and
fines sought by regulatory authorities in our industry have increased
substantially, and certain regulators have been more likely to commence
enforcement actions.
 
The requirements imposed
by our regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets
and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with Lehman Brothers.
Consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities, including
through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements. If we
were found to have breached certain of these rules or regulations, we could
face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities in all
jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses, including extended
investigation and surveillance activity, adoption of costly or restrictive new
regulations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in
substantial penalties. Among other things, we could be fined or prohibited from
engaging in some of our business activities.
 
Additional legislation and regulations, changes in rules
imposed by regulatory authorities, self-regulatory organizations and exchanges
or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may
adversely affect our business and profitability. Our business may be materially
affected not only by regulations applicable to us as an investment bank, but
also by regulations of general application, including existing and proposed tax
legislation and other governmental regulations and policies (including the
interest rate and monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board and other
central banks) and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing
laws and rules that affect the business and financial communities.
 
In emerging markets in particular, we may be subject
to risks of possible nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital
controls, currency exchange controls and other restrictive governmental
actions. In many countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the
securities and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving, and it
may be difficult for us to determine the exact requirements of local laws in
every market. We are also subject to greater risk in these jurisdictions that
transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in all cases. In
addition, in conducting business in these jurisdictions, we are often faced
with the challenge of ensuring that our activities are also consistent with
U.S. or other laws with extra-territorial application, such as the USA PATRIOT
Act and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Our failure to comply with such
laws could result in significant losses or reputational damage.
 
In the past several years, intensified scrutiny of
the energy market by federal, state and local authorities and the public has
resulted in increased regulatory and legal proceedings involving electricity,
natural gas and other energy commodities merchants. Our business and reputation
may be adversely affected by legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of
our energy commodities activities.
 
We are subject to the income tax laws of the
jurisdictions in which we have business operations. These tax laws are complex
and may be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the
relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and
interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when
determining the provision for income taxes. We are subject to contingent tax
risk that could adversely affect our results of operations, to the extent that
our interpretations of tax laws are disputed upon examination or audit, and are
settled in amounts in excess of established reserves for such contingencies.
See Part I, Item 1, BusinessRegulation for a further discussion of the
regulatory environment in which we conduct our businesses.
 
Our Mortgage Origination Business is Subject
to Special Litigation and Regulatory Risks. The laws and regulations of the various
jurisdictions in which we conduct our mortgage lending business are complex,
frequently changing and, in some cases, in direct conflict with each other. In
particular, this business is subject to various laws, regulations and guidance
that restrict non-prime loan origination or purchase activities. Some of these
laws and regulations provide for assignee liability for warehouse lenders,
whole loan buyers and securitization trusts. In addition, the downturn in the
U.S. residential real estate market has resulted in
increased regulatory scrutiny, and may result in increased complaints and claims,
relating to non-prime mortgage origination practices, and further difficulties
in the mortgage markets could result in increased exposure to liability,
including possible civil and criminal liability, demands for indemnification or
loan repurchases from purchasers of our loans (including securitization
trusts), class action lawsuits or administrative enforcement actions. Moreover,
our customer base and counterparties in this business are substantially
different from the high-net-worth and institutional customers and
counterparties of most of our other businesses, which presents a different
litigation risk profile.

LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
Exposure
to Reputational Risks Could Impact the Value of Our Brand. Our reputation is critical in maintaining
our relationships with clients, investors, regulators and the general public,
and is a key focus in our risk management efforts. In recent years,
there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving fraud, conflicts
of interest or other misconduct by employees in the financial services
industry, and we run the risk that misconduct by our employees could occur.
Misconduct by employees could include binding Lehman Brothers to transactions
that exceed authorized limits or present unacceptable risks, or hiding from
Lehman Brothers unauthorized or unsuccessful activities, which, in either case,
may result in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses. Employee misconduct could
also involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information, which
could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial
harm. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the
precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in
all cases. In addition, in certain circumstances our reputation could be
damaged by activities of our clients in which we participate, or of hedge funds
or other entities in which we invest, over which we have little or no control.
 
Potential
Conflicts of Interest Are Increasing. As
we have expanded the scope of our businesses and our client base, we
increasingly have to address potential conflicts of interest, including those
relating to our proprietary activities. For example, conflicts may arise
between our position as a financial advisor in a merger transaction and a
principal investment we hold in one of the parties to the transaction. In
addition, hedge funds and private equity funds are an increasingly important
portion of our client base, and also compete with us in a number of our
businesses. In addition, the SEC, FINRA, other federal and state regulators and
regulators outside the U.S., including in the U.K. and Japan, have increased
their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. We have extensive procedures
and controls that are intended to ensure that any potential conflicts of
interest are appropriately addressed. However, properly dealing with conflicts
of interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if we
fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest and,
it is possible that potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to
litigation or enforcement actions.
 
Competitive Environment
 
All aspects of our
business are highly competitive. Our competitive success depends on many
factors, including our reputation, the quality of our services and advice,
intellectual capital, product innovation, execution ability, pricing, sales
efforts, and the talent of our personnel. Many of our competitors have greater
capital resources and greater geographic reach than we do, which enhances their
competitive positions.
 
We
Face Increased Competition Due to a Trend Toward Consolidation. In recent years, there has been substantial consolidation
and convergence among companies in the financial services industry. In
particular, a number of large commercial banks, insurance companies and other
broad-based financial services firms have established or acquired
broker-dealers or have merged with other financial institutions. Many of these
firms have the ability to offer a wide range of products, from loans,
deposit-taking and insurance to brokerage, asset management and investment
banking services, which may enhance their competitive position. They also have
the ability to support investment banking and securities products with
commercial banking, insurance and other financial services revenues in an
effort to gain market share. These abilities have resulted in pricing pressure
in our businesses. We have experienced intense price competition in some of our
businesses in recent years. For example, equity and debt underwriting and
trading spreads and fees for lending and other activities have been under
competitive pressure for a number of years.
 
Our
Revenues May Decline Due to Competition from Alternative Trading Systems. Securities and futures transactions are now being conducted
through the internet and other alternative, non-traditional trading systems,
and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will continue
and probably accelerate. A dramatic increase in computer-based or other
electronic trading may adversely affect our commission and trading revenues,
including in our specialist business. The NYSEs adoption of its hybrid market
for trading securities may increase pressure on our Equities business as
customers execute more of their NYSE-related trades electronically. We have
invested significant resources into the development of electronic trading
systems and expect to continue to do so, but there is no assurance that the
revenues generated by these systems will yield an adequate return on our
investment, particularly given the relatively lower commissions arising from
electronic trades.
 
Our Ability to
Retain Our Key Employees is Critical to the Success of Our Business. Our
people are our most important resource. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in
our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract top talent and retain and
motivate our existing employees while managing compensation costs.

Risk Management
 
We have devoted
significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures
and expect to continue to do so in the future. Although we
deploy various risk mitigation and risk monitoring techniques, they are subject
to judgments as to the timing and duration of their application. Additionally,
no risk management procedure can anticipate every market event, and our
hedging strategies and other risk management techniques may not be fully
effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against
all types of risk, including risks that are unidentified or unanticipated. Some
of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical
market behavior. As a result, these methods may not predict future risk
exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures
indicate. The models that we use to assess and control our risk exposures
reflect historical correlations among prices of various asset classes or other
market indicators, and in times of market stress or other unforeseen
circumstances there may be material changes in correlations between asset classes.
In the past, including during the recent mortgage and credit market downturn,
these types of market movements have at times limited the effectiveness of our
hedging strategies and have caused us to incur significant losses, and they may
do so in the future. An increase in volatility would increase our measured
risk, which might cause us to reduce certain of our business activities. In
such circumstances, we may not be able to reduce our positions or our exposure
in a timely, cost-effective way or in a manner sufficient to offset the
increase in measured risk. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risk
requires, among other things, policies and procedures to record properly and
verify a large number of transactions and events, and these policies and
procedures may not be fully effective. See Part II, Item 7, Managements
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsRisk
Management for a discussion of the policies and procedures we use to identify,
monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses.
 
Risks Relating To New Business
Initiatives and New Markets
 
A number of our recent
and planned business initiatives and expansions of existing businesses may
bring us into contact, directly or indirectly, with new markets and new asset
classes and with entities and individuals that are not within our traditional
client base. For example, we have expanded our businesses and investments in
emerging markets such as Russia, the Middle East, India, Turkey and China, have
increased our activities in the markets for derivatives, commodities and
foreign exchange and have begun providing loans to small and mid-sized
businesses and students. In addition, we are increasingly offering complex
structured products and alternative investments to a wider investor base, both
directly and through third-party distribution channels. These business
activities expose us to new and enhanced risks, including increased
credit-related and operational risks, regulatory risks and reputational
concerns. As our business expands into new markets and new geographical
regions, we will face competitors with more experience and more established
relationships with clients, regulators and industry participants in the
relevant market, which could adversely affect our ability to expand.

ITEM 3.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 
We are
involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings
concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of our business. Such
proceedings include actions brought against us and others with respect to
transactions in which we acted as an underwriter or financial advisor, actions
arising out of our activities as a broker or dealer in securities and
commodities and actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants
against many securities and commodities firms, including us.
 
Although
there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome, we generally have denied,
or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny, liability in all
significant cases pending against us, including the matters described below,
and we intend to defend vigorously each such case. Based on information
currently available, we believe the amount, or range, of reasonably possible
losses in connection with the actions against us, including the matters
described below, in excess of established reserves, in the aggregate, not to be
material to the Companys consolidated financial condition or cash flows.
However, losses may be material to our operating results for any particular
future period, depending on the level of our income for such period.
 
City of Cleveland v. Deutsche Bank Trust Company, et al.
 
On
January 10, 2008, the City of Cleveland, Ohio filed a lawsuit in Cuyahoga
County Common Pleas Court, captioned City of Cleveland v.
Deutsche Bank Trust Company, et al., against twenty-one financial
services entities, including Holdings, seeking damages the City of Cleveland
allegedly incurred relating to property foreclosures. The damages are claimed
to be the result of the defendants creation of a public nuisance in the City
of Cleveland through their involvement as lenders and/or securitizers of
sub-prime mortgages in the City of Cleveland. On January 16, 2008, the case was
removed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio,
and on January 17, 2008, the City of Cleveland filed a motion seeking an order
remanding the case back to Common Pleas Court.
 
First Alliance Mortgage Company Matters
 
During 1999 and the first quarter of 2000, LCPI provided a warehouse
line of credit to First Alliance Mortgage Company (FAMCO), a subprime mortgage
lender, and LBI underwrote the securitizations of mortgages originated by
FAMCO. In March 2000, FAMCO filed for bankruptcy protection in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California (the California
Bankruptcy Court). In August 2001, a class action (the Class Action) was
filed in the California Bankruptcy Court, on behalf of a class of FAMCO
borrowers seeking equitable subordination of LCPIs (among other creditors)
liens and claims. In October 2001, the complaint was amended to add LBI as a
defendant and to add claims for aiding and abetting fraudulent lending
activities by FAMCO and for unfair competition under the California Business
and Professions Code. In August 2002,
a Second Amended Complaint was filed which added a claim for punitive damages
and extended the class period from May 1, 1996 until FAMCOs bankruptcy filing.
The complaint sought actual and punitive damages, the imposition of a
constructive trust on all proceeds paid by FAMCO to LCPI and LBI, disgorgement
of profits and attorneys fees and costs.
 
The United States District Court for the Central District of California
(the California District Court) withdrew the reference to the California
Bankruptcy Court. A class was certified in November 2002, and subsequently
amended, to certify the Class Action as being brought on behalf of a class of
all persons who acquired mortgage loans from FAMCO from 1999 through March 31,
2000, which were used as collateral for FAMCOs warehouse credit line with LCPI
or were securitized in transactions underwritten by LBI. The trial began in
February 2003.
 
In June 2003, the California District Court dismissed plaintiffs claim
for punitive damages. Also in June 2003, the jury rendered its verdict, finding
LBI and LCPI liable for aiding and abetting FAMCOs fraud. The jury found
damages of $50.9 million and held the Lehman defendants responsible for 10% of
those damages. In July 2003, the California District Court entered findings of
fact and conclusions of law relating to all claims still pending and holding
that any transfers to LCPI were not fraudulent and its liens were not
avoidable, nor was equitable subordination of amounts owed by FAMCO to LCPI at
the time of the Chapter 11 filing warranted. Judgment was entered in November 2003
on the jury verdict. On December 8, 2006, the United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit issued a decision on the appeals of all parties,
affirming the jury verdict on liability, rejecting all plaintiffs claims for
further relief, vacating the damages verdict and remanding the matter for
further proceedings on the proper calculation of out of pocket damages rather
than the higher benefit of the bargain damages upon which the jury based its
verdict. The parties to the Class Action have entered into a settlement
agreement, which was presented to the California District Court for preliminary
approval on January 28, 2008.
 
IPO Allocation Cases
 
Securities
Action. LBI was named as a
defendant in numerous purported securities class actions that were filed
between March and December 2001 in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (the New York District Court). The actions,
which allege improper initial public offering (IPO) allocation practices,
were brought by persons who, either directly or in the aftermarket, purchased
IPO securities during the period between March 1997 and December 2000. The
plaintiffs allege that LBI and other IPO underwriters required persons
receiving allocations of IPO shares to pay excessive commissions on unrelated
trades and to purchase shares in the aftermarket at specified escalating
prices. The plaintiffs, who seek unspecified compensatory damages, claim that
these alleged practices violated various

consolidated for pretrial purposes before a single judge. LBI is named as a
defendant in 83 of those cases. For pretrial coordination purposes, the parties
also designated certain focus cases, which were to be used as guidance for
decisions in all cases. On October 13, 2004, the New York District Court
granted plaintiffs motion for certification of a class of investors in each of
six focus cases. On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit  (the Second Circuit), the
court, on December 5, 2006, overturned the decision below, set forth the
standards for class certification and concluded that classes could not be
certified based on the facts alleged by plaintiffs. On June 6, 2007, the Second
Circuit denied plaintiffs petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc of that decision. Upon remand to
the New York District Court, on August 14, 2007, the plaintiffs filed amended
complaints.
 
Issuer Action. In April 2002, a suit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court
by Breakaway Solutions Inc. (Breakaway), which names LBI and two other
underwriters as defendants (the Delaware Action). The complaint purported to
be brought on behalf of a class of issuers who issued securities in IPOs
through at least one of the defendants during the period January 1998 through October
2000 and whose securities increased in value 15% or more above the original
price within 30 days after the IPO. It alleged that defendants under-priced IPO
securities and allocated those under-priced securities to certain favored
customers in return for alleged arrangements with the customers for increased
commissions on other transactions and alleged tie-in arrangements. The
complaint asserted claims for breaches of contract, of the implied covenant of
good faith and fair dealing and of fiduciary duty, and for indemnification or
contribution and unjust enrichment or restitution. Relief sought included class
certification, injunctive relief, an accounting and declarations requiring defendants
to indemnify Breakaway in the pending consolidated IPO securities class
actions, and compensatory damages. In August 2004, the court denied defendants
motion to dismiss. On motion by defendants, the court reconsidered its prior
decision and, by order dated December 8, 2005, dismissed all but Breakaways
claim for breach of fiduciary duty.
 
In September 2005,
Breakaway commenced an individual action in the New York State Supreme Court,
New York County, naming the same defendants (the New York Action). This
action alleges that LBI, as a co-manager of Breakaways initial public offering
and in conjunction with the other underwriter defendants, breached a fiduciary
duty to Breakaway and breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing
implied in the underwriting agreement among Breakaway and the underwriters by
allegedly under-pricing Breakaways shares in the IPO.
 
On January 11, 2008, the
parties settled both the Delaware Action and the New York Action and filed
stipulations of dismissal in both actions.
 
IPO Fee Litigation
 
Harold Gillet, et al. v. Goldman Sachs & Co., et al.;
Yakov Prager, et al. v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., et al.; David Holzman, et al.
v. Goldman, Sachs & Co., et al. Beginning in November 1998, four purported class actions were filed in the
New York District Court against in excess of 25 underwriters of IPO securities,
including LBI. The cases were subsequently consolidated into In re Public Offering Antitrust Litigation. Plaintiffs,
alleged purchasers of securities issued in certain IPOs, seek compensatory and
injunctive relief for alleged violations of the antitrust laws based on the
theory that the defendants fixed and maintained fees for underwriting certain
IPO securities at supra-competitive levels. In February 2001, the New York
District Court granted defendants motion to dismiss the consolidated amended
complaint, concluding that the purchaser plaintiffs lacked standing under the
antitrust laws to assert the claims. On appeal, the Second Circuit reversed and
remanded the case to the New York District Court for further proceedings,
including potential dismissal of the claims based on additional arguments
raised in the motion to dismiss. The New York District Court, in an order dated
February 24, 2004, dismissed plaintiffs claims for monetary damages allowing
only their claims for injunctive relief to proceed. Further activity in this
case is stayed pending resolution of class certification issues in the
following case.
 
In re Issuer Plaintiff Initial Public Offering Fee Antitrust
Litigation. In April 2001,
the New York District Court consolidated four actions pending before the court
brought by bankrupt issuers of IPO securities against more than 20 underwriter
defendants (including LBI). In July 2001, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated
class action complaint seeking unspecified compensatory damages and injunctive
relief for alleged violations of the antitrust laws based on the theory that
the defendant underwriters fixed and maintained fees for underwriting certain
IPO securities at supra-competitive levels. Two of the four original plaintiffs
subsequently withdrew their claims. The remaining
plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which the New York District
Court denied in an order, dated April 19, 2006. On September 11, 2007, the
Second Circuit reversed the New York District Courts denial of class
certification and remanded the case to the New York District Court for further
proceedings to determine if the case may proceed as a class action.

Mirant
Corporation Securities Litigation
 
In November 2002, an
amended complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division, and captioned In re Mirant Corporation Securities Litigation.
The action is brought on behalf of a purported class of investors who purchased
the securities of Mirant Corporation (Mirant) during the period from September
26, 2000 and September 5, 2002. Plaintiffs name Mirant, various officers and
directors, Mirants former parent, The Southern Company, along with its
officers and directors, LBI, as a member of the underwriting syndicate, and
eleven other underwriters of Mirants IPO of common stock in September 2000.
The underwriters are contractually entitled to customary indemnification from
Mirant, but Mirant filed for bankruptcy protection in July 2003. The IPO raised
approximately $1.467 billion, of which Lehman Brothers underwriting share was
9%. Against the underwriters, plaintiffs allege violations of Section 11 of the
Securities Act. The complaint alleges that the prospectus and registration
statement for the offering contained false and misleading statements or failed
to disclose material facts concerning, among other things, Mirants alleged
misconduct in energy markets in the State of California, the accounting for
Mirants interest in a United Kingdom-based company, Western Power
Distribution, and other accounting issues. The complaint seeks class action
certification, unspecified damages and costs. Partially dispositive motions are
pending.
 
Research Analyst Independence Litigations
 
Since the announcement of the global regulatory
settlement regarding alleged research analyst conflicts of interest at various
investment banking firms in the United States, including LBI, in April 2003
(the Global Settlement), a number of purported class actions were filed
relating to such alleged conflicts. Three consolidated actions had been filed
against LBI in federal court, two of which have since been dismissed, which are
specific to LBIs research of particular companies. The actions allege
conflicts of interest between LBIs investment banking business and research
activities and seek to assert claims pursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. In the remaining pending action, relating to RSL Communications,
plaintiffs have filed an amended consolidated complaint, containing essentially
the same allegations as the original complaints, but adding two other
investment banks as defendants (Fogarazzo, et al. v. Lehman Brothers Inc., et
al.). On July 27, 2005, the New York District Court granted plaintiffs motion
for class certification. On January 26, 2007, the Second Circuit accepted the
defendants appeal, vacated the decision below and remanded the case to the New
York District Court in light of the decision in the IPO Allocation Securities
Action case discussed above. On June 29, 2007, the New York District Court
stayed all proceedings in the case pending the Second Circuits decision
in In re Salomon Analyst Metromedia, which
raises similar legal issues.
 
In June 2003, a purported derivative action, Bader and Yakaitis P.S.P. and Trust, et al. v. Michael L. Ainslie, et
al., relating to the Global Settlement was filed in New York State
Supreme Court, New York County. The suit names Holdings and its then sitting
Board of Directors (the Board) as defendants and contends that the Board
should have been aware of and prevented the alleged misconduct that resulted in
the Global Settlement. In December 2003, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,
reiterating the allegations concerning the alleged failure to detect and
prevent conduct resulting in the Global Settlement, and adding allegations
concerning the alleged failure to detect and prevent conduct relating to
purportedly improper IPO allocation practices, discussed more fully above under
the heading IPO Allocation Cases.
 
Short
Sales Related Litigation
 
In re Short Sale Antitrust Litigation. Commencing
in April 2006, LBI was named as a defendant in putative class actions relating
to short selling filed in the New York District Court. In December 2006, the
court ordered that the actions be consolidated and renamed the In re Short Sale Antitrust Litigation. By January 2007, only
one plaintiff, Electronic Trading Group, remained in the case (after earlier-named
plaintiffs dropped out). A second amended complaint was filed, purportedly on
behalf of those who had paid certain fees to broker dealers in connection with
borrowing securities against 17 broker-dealers and other unnamed defendants,
including LBI. The complaint asserted four causes of action: violations of Section
1 of the Sherman Act, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting breaches of
fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. Plaintiff sought injunctive relief and
unspecified trebled compensatory and punitive damages. On December 20, 2007,
the New York District Court granted defendants motion to dismiss the second
amended complaint. On January 18, 2008, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of
the New York District Court decision with the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit.
 
Avenius, et al. v. Banc of America Securities LLC, et al. In June 2006,
LBI was named as a defendant in an action filed by 40 shareholders of Novastar
Financial, Inc. (NFI) against 11 broker-dealers and other unnamed defendants
in the Superior Court of California for San Francisco County (California
Superior Court). The action alleges that the broker-dealers participated in an
illegal stock market manipulation scheme that involved accepting orders for
purchases, sales and short sales of NFI stock with no intention of covering
such orders with borrowed stock or stock issued by NFI. Plaintiffs claim that
this scheme caused distortions with regard to the nature and amount of active
trading in NFI stock, thereby causing its share price to decline. The
complaints assert causes of action under California Corporations Code

LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
Sections
25400, et seq. and California Business and Professions Code Sections 17200, et
seq. and 17500, et seq. The actions seek unspecified damages. On September
14, 2007, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint to, among other things, assert
claims for conversion and trespass to chattels, in addition to the causes of
action previously asserted.
 
Overstock.com,
Inc., et al. v. Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc., et al. On September
14, 2007, LBI was named as a defendant in an amended complaint filed by
Overstock.com, Inc. (Overstock) and seven of its shareholders against 11
broker-dealers and other unnamed defendants in the California Superior Court.
The allegations are similar to those in the Avenius action
described above. Plaintiffs claim that this scheme caused distortions with
regard to the nature and amount of active trading in Overstock stock, thereby
causing its share price to decline. The complaints assert the same causes of
action as the Avenius complaint.
 
Wright et al. v. Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. et al.
 
In August 2005, A. Vernon Wright and Dynoil Refining
LLC sued Holdings (who was subsequently dropped as a defendant), LBI and two
current and one former LBI employee, in Los Angeles Superior Court (the Wright
action). Plaintiffs claimed negligence, breach of contract, breach of duties
of good faith and fair dealing and of fiduciary duty, interference with
prospective business advantage and misappropriation of trade secrets. Plaintiffs
alleged that Wright provided Lehman Brothers with confidential information that
Wright, along with certain Chinese interests, intended to buy Unocal, which
Lehman Brothers allegedly did not keep confidential, preventing Wright from
executing his plan. In his complaint, plaintiffs sought $9.2 billion, the
alleged value of the U.S. assets plaintiffs say they would have acquired. On January
10, 2008 the parties entered into a confidential settlement, and the Court
dismissed the action.
 
In March 2006, Carlton Energy Group, Muskeg Oil Co and
Newco filed a similar suit against Holdings (again, later dropped), LBI and
three LBI employees in state court in Harris County, Texas. The three plaintiff
entities are owned or controlled by Thomas ODell and Daniel Chiang, erstwhile
business partners of Vernon Wright. The claims and allegations asserted in this
action are similar to those asserted in the Wright action. Plaintiffs sought
unspecified damages. Pursuant to a
confidential settlement agreement, on October 18, 2007, the plaintiffs filed a
stipulation of voluntary dismissal.
 
In re Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.
Derivative Litigation
 
Beginning in mid-April 2007, three purported
shareholder derivative actions were filed against Holdings (as a nominal
defendant) and certain of its current and former officers and directors in the
New York District Court, all relating to Holdings historical stock option
granting processes. The cases were captioned, 
Garber v. Fuld, et al.; Staehr v. Fuld, et al.; and Locals 302 &
612 of the International Union of Operating Engineers-Employers Construction
Industry Retirement Trust v. Fuld, et al. An additional plaintiff,
Saginaw Police & Fire Pension Board, intervened in the Garber
action. On October 3, 2007, the court consolidated the above actions, appointed
Plaintiffs Garber and the Saginaw Police & Fire Pension Board as lead
plaintiffs, and re-captioned the action  In re Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. Derivative Litigation.
 
On or about January 3, 2008, lead plaintiffs filed a
Consolidated Complaint and a motion to join the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers Local No. 38 Pension Fund as an additional plaintiff. The
Consolidated Complaint, purportedly brought on behalf of Holdings, alleges
state law claims for breach of fiduciary duty, gross mismanagement,
misappropriation and/or waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment,
misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment, and invalidation of certain stock
options and restricted stock units.
 
The Consolidated Complaint alleges that stock options
and restricted stock units granted by Holdings between 1997 and 2002 were
backdated and issued in violation of Holdings stock option plans. The
Consolidated Complaint further alleges that Holdings financial statements for
the years 1997 through the present misstated Holdings financial results by
failing to properly report compensation expense and tax liabilities
attributable to stock options and restricted stock units granted between 1997
and 2002. The Consolidated Complaint seeks damages from the individual
defendants and various types of equitable and injunctive relief, including
rescission of all unexercised stock options and restricted stock units granted
in the time frame, return of certain incentive-based or equity-based compensation,
and imposition of a constructive trust and attachment of assets.

(1)     We
have an ongoing common stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we
repurchase shares in the open market. As previously announced, in January 2007
our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions,
of up to 100 million shares of Holdings common stock, for the management of
the Firms equity capital, including offsetting dilution due to employee stock
awards. This authorization superseded the stock repurchase program authorized
in January 2006. The number of shares authorized to be repurchased in the open
market is reduced by the actual number of Employee Offset Shares (as defined
below) received.
(2)     Represents
shares of common stock withheld in satisfaction of the exercise price of stock
options and tax withholding obligations upon option exercises and conversion of
restricted stock units (collectively, Employee Offset Shares).
In January 2008, our
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of
up to 100 million shares of Holdings common stock for the management of the
Firms equity capital, including consideration of dilution due to employee
stock awards. This resolution supersedes the stock purchase program authorized
in 2007.  For more information about the
repurchase program and employee stock plans, see Managements Discussion and

Notes to Selected Financial Data:
(1)                Non-personnel expenses exclude real
estate reconfiguration charges of $19 million and $77 million for the years
ended November 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
(2)                We adopted FIN 46(R) effective February
29, 2004, which required us to deconsolidate the trusts that issued the
preferred securities. Accordingly, at and subsequent to February 29, 2004,
preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption were reclassified to
junior subordinated notes, a component of long-term borrowings. Dividends on
preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption, which were presented as
Dividends on trust preferred securities in the Consolidated Statement of Income
through February 29, 2004, are included in Interest expense in periods
subsequent to February 29, 2004.
(3)                We calculate net assets by excluding
from total assets: (i) cash and securities segregated and on deposit for
regulatory and other purposes; (ii) collateralized lending agreements; and (iii)
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. We believe net assets to be a more
useful measure of our assets than total assets because it excludes certain
low-risk, non-inventory assets. Net assets as presented are not necessarily
comparable to similarly-titled measures provided by other companies in the
securities industry because of different methods of presentation.

(4)                Long-term borrowings

(at November 30, 2003, preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption),
and excluding identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. See MD&ALiquidity,
Funding and Capital ResourcesBalance Sheet and Financial Leverage for
additional information about tangible equity capital. We believe tangible
equity capital to be a more meaningful measure of our equity base as it
includes instruments we consider to be equity-like due to their subordinated
nature, long-term maturity and interest deferral features and excludes assets
we do not consider available to support our remaining net assets (see note 3
above). These measures may not be comparable to other, similarly titled
calculations by other companies as a result of different calculation methodologies.

(a)                 Preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption at

(b)                Our definition for tangible equity capital limits the
amount of junior subordinated notes and preferred stock included in the
calculation to 25% of tangible equity capital. The amount excluded was
approximately $237 million at November 30, 2007. No amounts were excluded in
prior periods.
(6)                Total long-term capital
includes long-term borrowings (excluding any borrowings with remaining
contractual maturities within twelve months of the financial statement date)
and total stockholders equity and, at November 30, 2003, preferred securities
subject to mandatory redemption. We believe total long-term capital is useful
to investors as a measure of our financial strength.
(7)                Common share and per

(8)                The book value per
common share calculation includes amortized restricted stock units granted
under employee stock award programs, which have been included in total
stockholders equity.
(9)                 Leverage ratio is
defined as total assets divided by total stockholders equity.
(10)             Net leverage ratio is
defined as net assets (see note 3 above) divided by tangible equity capital
(see note 5 above). We believe net leverage based on net assets and tangible
equity capital to be a more meaningful measure of leverage as net assets
excludes certain low-risk, non-inventory assets and we believe tangible equity
capital to be a more meaningful measure of our equity base. Net leverage as
presented is not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures provided
by other companies in the securities industry because of different methods of
presentation.

Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 

Introduction

 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (Holdings) and subsidiaries (collectively,
the Company, the Firm, Lehman Brothers, we, us or our) serves the
financial needs of corporations, governments and municipalities, institutional
clients and high net worth individuals worldwide with business activities
organized in three segments, Capital Markets, Investment Banking and Investment
Management. Founded in 1850, Lehman Brothers maintains market presence in
equity and fixed income sales, trading and research, investment banking, asset
management, private investment management and private equity. The Firm is
headquartered in New York, with regional headquarters in London and Tokyo, and
operates in a network of offices in North America, Europe, the Middle East,
Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. We are a member of all principal
securities and commodities exchanges in the U.S., and we hold memberships or
associate memberships on several principal international securities and
commodities exchanges, including the London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Frankfurt,
Paris, Milan and Australian stock exchanges.
 
This Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read together with the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes contained in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2007 (the Form 10-K). Unless specifically stated otherwise, all
references to the years 2007, 2006 and 2005 in this MD&A refer to our
fiscal years ended November 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, or the last day of
such fiscal years, as the context requires. All share and per share amounts
have been retrospectively adjusted for the two-for-one common stock split,
effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend, which became effective April 28,
2006. For additional information, see 2-for-1 Stock Split in this MD&A
and Note 10, Stockholders Equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 

Forward-Looking Statements

 
Some of the statements contained in this MD&A, including those
relating to our strategy and other statements that are predictive in nature,
that depend on or refer to future events or conditions or that include words
such as expects, anticipates, intends, plans, believes, estimates
and similar expressions, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These statements are not
historical facts but instead represent only managements expectations,
estimates and projections regarding future events. Similarly, these statements
are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and
uncertainties that are difficult to predict, which may include, but are not
limited to, market risk, investor sentiment, liquidity risk, credit ratings
changes, credit exposure and operational, legal, regulatory and reputational
risks. For further discussion of these risks, see Certain Risk Factors Affecting Results of Operations
below as well as Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K.
 
As a global investment bank, the nature of our business makes predicting
future performance difficult. Revenues and earnings may vary from quarter to
quarter and from year to year. Caution should be used when extrapolating
historical results to future periods. Our actual results and financial
condition may differ, perhaps materially, from the anticipated results and
financial condition in any such forward-looking statements and, accordingly,
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which
speak only as of the date on which they are made. We undertake no obligation to
update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.
 

Executive Overview1

 
Summary of Results
 
On the basis of a record first half and a reasonably successful navigation
of difficult market conditions in the second half, we achieved our fourth
consecutive year of record net revenues, net income and diluted earnings per
common share in 2007. Net income totaled $4.2 billion, $4.0 billion and $3.3
billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, increasing 5% in 2007 and 23% in
2006 from the corresponding 2006 and 2005 periods, respectively. Diluted
earnings per common share were $7.26, $6.81 and $5.43 in 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, up 7% in 2007 and 25% in 2006 from the corresponding prior
periods, respectively.2

Market share, volume and ranking statistics in this
  MD&A were obtained from Thomson Financial, an operating unit of The
  Thomson Corporation.

The 2006 results
  included an after-tax gain of $47 million ($0.08 per diluted common share)
  from the cumulative effect of an accounting change for equity-based
  compensation resulting from the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial
  Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123 (revised), Share-Based
  Payment (SFAS 123(R)). For additional information, see Note 12,
  Share-Based Employee Incentive Plans, to the Consolidated Financial
  Statements.

LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
2007 net revenues were
$19.3 billion, which exceeded the prior year record level by 10% and represents
the fifth consecutive year of record net revenues. The second half of the 2007
fiscal year presented some of the most challenging mortgage and credit markets
experienced in almost a decade, particularly in the U.S. Record net revenues
were reported in each of our three business segments and in both the Europe and
the Middle East and Asia-Pacific geographic segments. Pre-tax margin for the
2007 fiscal year was 31.2%, compared to 33.6% and 33.0% reported in 2006 and
2005, respectively. Full year return on average common stockholders equity1
was 20.8%, 23.4% and 21.6% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Return on average
tangible common stockholders equity was 25.7%, 29.1% and 27.8% in full years
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
2007 vs. 2006. In 2007,
Capital Markets segment net revenues increased 2% to a record $12.3 billion
from $12.0 billion in 2006. Capital MarketsEquities, operating in a favorable
environment of strong customer-driven activity and favorable global equities
markets, reported net revenues of $6.3 billion in 2007, a 76% increase from
$3.6 billion in 2006. These record results in the Equities component of our
Capital Markets business segment were offset by a decrease in Capital
MarketsFixed Incomes net revenues which declined 29% to $6.0 billion in 2007
from $8.4 billion in 2006. This decline corresponds to the deterioration
throughout the fiscal year in the U.S. residential mortgage sector and the
follow-on dislocation in the broader credit markets that occurred later in the
fiscal year. Investment Banking segment net revenues increased 24% to $3.9
billion in 2007 from $3.2 billion in 2006, representing record Debt and Equity
underwriting-related activities as well as record Advisory Services revenues.
These results reflect the significant progress made in building market share in
the areas of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and high yield offerings as
well as the development of a broader range of geographic and client bases.
Investment Management segment net revenues increased 28% to $3.1 billion in
2007 from $2.4 billion in 2006, reflecting record net revenues in both Asset
Management and Private Investment Management and our continued expansion of
this business segment globally. For the fiscal year, assets under management (AUM)
of $282 billion increased 25% from 2006 from both net inflows and asset
appreciation. NonU.S. net revenues increased 49% to $9.6 billion in 2007 from
$6.5 billion in 2006, representing 50% and 37% of total net revenues in the
2007 and 2006 periods, respectively.
 
2006 vs. 2005. Net
revenues increased 20% in 2006 from 2005. Capital Markets segment net revenues
increased 22% to $12.0 billion in 2006 from $9.8 billion in 2005. Capital
MarketsEquities net revenues rose 44% to $3.6 billion in 2006 from $2.5
billion in 2005, driven by solid clientflow activity in the cash and prime
services businesses. Capital MarketsFixed Income net revenues increased 15% to
$8.4 billion in 2006 from $7.3 billion in 2005 due to broad-based strength
across products and regions. Investment Banking segment net revenues increased
9% to $3.2 billion in 2006 from $2.9 billion in 2005, reflecting strength in
each business. Investment Management segment net revenues increased 25% to $2.4
billion in 2006 from $1.9 billion in 2005, reflecting growth in alternative
investment offerings and an increase in equity-related activity. In 2006, AUM
increased 29% to $225 billion from $175 billion in 2005. NonU.S. net revenues
increased 21% to $6.5 billion in 2006 from $5.4 billion in 2005, representing
37% of total net revenues for both the 2006 and 2005 periods.
 
While we generated record
operating results in 2007, our business, by its nature, does not produce
predictable earnings. Our results in any given period can be materially
affected by conditions in global financial markets and economic conditions
generally. For a further discussion of factors that may affect our future
operating results, see Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations below
as well as Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K. For a

Return on average common stockholders equity and
  return on average tangible common stockholders equity are computed by
  dividing net income applicable to common stock for the period by average
  common stockholders equity and average tangible common stockholders equity,
  respectively. We believe average tangible common stockholders equity is a
  meaningful measure because it reflects the common stockholders equity
  deployed in our businesses. Average tangible common stockholders equity
  equals average common stockholders equity less average identifiable
  intangible assets and goodwill and is computed as follows:

Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
discussion of results of
operations by business segments and geographic regions, see Business Segments
and Geographic Revenues.
 
Business Environment
 
As an investment banking, securities and investment management firm, our
businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial
markets and worldwide economic conditions. A favorable business environment is
generally characterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic
product growth, stable geopolitical conditions, transparent and efficient
capital markets, liquid markets with active investors, low inflation, high
business and consumer confidence and strong business earnings. These factors
provide a positive climate for our investment banking activities, for many of
our capital markets trading businesses and for wealth creation, which
contributes to growth in our asset management business. For a further
discussion of how market conditions can affect our business, see Certain
Factors Affecting Results of Operations below as well as Risk Factors in
Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K. A further discussion of the business
environment in 2007 and economic outlook for 2008 is set forth below.
 
The global market environment was generally favorable for our businesses
for the first half of the 2007 fiscal year. These favorable conditions resulted
from a number of factors: strong equity markets, continued strong gross
domestic product in most major economies, tightening credit spreads, minimal
interest rate actions by major central banks, active trading volumes, and
strong M&A and underwriting activities driven by favorable interest rate
and credit spread environments. During the second half of the 2007 fiscal year,
the global economy was impacted by the deterioration within the U.S. subprime
residential mortgage asset category, the weakening of the U.S. housing sector
became worse than most observers expected and dislocations began to occur
beyond the residential mortgage component of credit markets. Also during the
latter part of the 2007 fiscal year, risk aversion escalated following rating
agency downgrades of certain structured assets which, in part, led to many
market participants re-pricing assets and taking large write-downs. Central
banks sought to prevent a more serious downturn by central bank interest rate
and liquidity actions. Our fiscal year ended with dislocated inter-bank
markets, constrained bank balance sheets and credit uncertainty regarding
monoline issuers and structured investment vehicles.
 
The global fixed income environment was characterized by spreads
tightening in the first half of the year and, conversely, unprecedented spread
widening in the second half of the year. Global high yield and high grade
spread indices ended our fiscal year up 209 and 86 basis points, respectively,
compared to the end of our 2006 fiscal year. Global equity markets rose over
the fiscal year; however, many equity markets experienced high volatility in the
second half of the year. Globally, corporate activity levels in completed and
announced M&A transactions were up compared to our last fiscal year. In
addition, equity underwriting activity remained solid, particularly in
convertibles; but debt underwriting activity declined, particularly in
leveraged finance during the second half of the 2007 fiscal year.
 
Global economic growth was approximately 3.4% for calendar year 2007 and
is forecasted to be lower for calendar year 2008. Our forecast differs by
geographies: our growth assumptions for the Americas and Eurozone are lower
than those for Asia and other territories. Our growth outlook is dependent on
how extended and severe the credit dislocation may be, results from fiscal and
monetary policy actions, accessibility of new sources of liquidity and oil
prices leveling or continuing to increase. The underpinnings of these growth
assumptions also form our view on prospective Investment Banking activity. We
expect M&A volumes to decline in 2008 by approximately 20% as compared to
2007 and believe that (i) strategic buyers will continue to account for a
larger proportion of overall deal volume, (ii) stock will become prominent
in transactions and (iii) cross-border and international activity will
continue to increase. If the anticipated higher volatility in global equity
markets is realized in calendar 2008, we expect equity issuance will be down
compared to 2007. Equity capital markets experienced a 17% return in 2007 in
local currency terms, and we expect lower returns in 2008. We expect global
fixed income origination to decline in 2008 as a result of lower volumes of
securitizations and M&A financings. Fixed income capital markets are
expected to continue to face uncertainties in the 2008 calendar year.
 
In the U.S., economic growth showed signs of strength at the beginning of
our fiscal year, driven by higher net exports and consumption levels, among
other indicators, but the pace of growth slowed in the latter half. Over the
twelve-month period, the U.S. housing market weakened, business confidence
declined, and, in the last six months of the year, consumer confidence dropped.
The labor market followed the same trajectory, showing signs of deterioration
in the second half of the period as unemployment levels increased modestly and
payroll data showed some signs of weakness. Responding to concerns over
liquidity in the financial markets and inflationary pressures, the U.S. Federal
Reserve reduced rates three times during the calendar year and made an
additional inter-meeting rate cut in January 2008, and most observers
anticipate additional reductions will occur in the early part of our 2008
fiscal year. Long-term bond yields declined, with the 10-year Treasury note
yield ending our fiscal year down 52 basis points at 3.94%. The S&P 500
Index, Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ composites were up 5.7%, 9.4%,
and 9.4%, respectively, from November 2006 levels. The current high levels
of U.S. home inventories suggest that an extended period of construction
declines and housing price cuts will

combine with tighter credit conditions and increasing oil prices to slow
down consumer spending. We believe those conditions will continue to strain the
capital markets, particularly the securitized products and residential housing
components. We also believe that those conditions will stress other components
of the capital markets, such as commercial real estate. We believe these
impediments will decrease the U.S. growth rate in 2008.
 
In Eurozone countries and the U.K., economic growth continued in the
second half of the 2007 fiscal year, although it was modest compared to the
first half. Business activity reflected a slight tapering at the end of the
fiscal year. Unemployment levels declined over the fiscal year, and
inflationary pressures appeared contained. The European Central Bank increased
rates twice during our fiscal year and is forecasted to hold those levels
through the early part of our 2008 fiscal year. The Bank of England (the BOE)
increased rates three times during our fiscal year, and in December 2007
the BOE began to ease with a rate reduction. Further rate reductions are
anticipated in the early part of the 2008 calendar year. The Bund and Gilts
10-year yields were 4.13% and 4.64%, respectively, at the end of our 2007
fiscal year compared to 3.70% and 4.51%, respectively, at the end of our 2006
fiscal year. Equity indices and volatility for continental Europe and the U.K.
were up compared to levels at the end of our 2006 fiscal year. At the end of
our 2007 fiscal year, stresses in the banking system, particularly in the U.K,
were causing bank credit conditions to tighten. We believe that those tighter
conditions, lower anticipated world growth and a stronger Euro will combine to
slow regional growth for our upcoming 2008 fiscal year.
 
In Japan, real gross
domestic product growth decelerated, unemployment levels modestly decreased and
deflation eased during our 2007 fiscal year. The Bank of Japan increased its
rates in early 2007 and held those rates for the remainder of our fiscal year,
and is anticipated to continue to do so into our 2008 fiscal year. The yield on
the 10-year Japanese government bond fell 18 basis points to 1.48% at the end
of our 2007 fiscal year. The Nikkei 225 equity index was 3.6% lower at the end
of our fiscal year than its level at the end of our 2006 fiscal year. Residential
and non-residential construction spending is decreasing, and the recovery in
the corporate sector during the period has yet to have an effect on wages and
consumption, thus increasing the risk of a possible recession. Elsewhere in
Asia, however, equity markets broadly ended our fiscal year higher compared to
the prior period. We expect three trends to emerge in Chinas economy in 2008: (i) GDP
growth to fall on an annual basis for the first time in six years; (ii) inflation
to increase over the long-term; and (iii) overcapacity concerns to shape
central bank actions. During 2008, we expect India to exhibit many of the same
characteristics that Japan, South Korea and China did during their economic
takeoffs: GDP accelerating, investment and savings rates surging and the
economy rapidly opening up. Effects from the regions dependency on exports and
severe overcapacity may exacerbate the regional growth slowdown predicted for
2008.
 

Certain Factors Affecting Results of Operations

 
We are exposed to a variety of risks in the course of conducting our
business operations. These risks, which are substantial and inherent in our
businesses, include market, liquidity, credit, operational, legal and
regulatory risks. A summary of some of the significant risks that could affect
our financial condition and results of operations includes, but is not limited
to the items below. For a discussion of how management seeks to manage these
risks, see Risk Management in this MD&A. For a further discussion of
these and other important factors that could affect our business, see Risk
Factors in Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K.
 
Market Conditions and Market Risk
 
Global financial markets and economic conditions materially affect our
businesses. Market conditions may change rapidly and without forewarning. We
believe a favorable business environment for our businesses is generally
characterized by, among other factors, high global gross domestic product
growth, stable geopolitical conditions, transparent and efficient capital markets,
liquid markets with active investors, low inflation, high business and consumer
confidence and strong business earnings. The converses of these factors,
individually or in their aggregate, have resulted in or may result in
unfavorable or uncertain market and economic conditions for our businesses. The
effects on our businesses may include the following:
 
·                We are exposed to
potential changes in the value of financial instruments caused by fluctuations
in interest rates, exchange rates, equity and fixed income securities and
commodities and real estate prices, credit spreads, liquidity volatility,
overall market activity or other conditions. We may incur losses as a result of
changes in market conditions, especially if the changes are rapid and without
warning, as these fluctuations may adversely impact the valuation of our
trading and inventory positions and principal investments.
 
·                Market
fluctuations and volatility may reduce our or our customers willingness to
enter into new transactions. Conversely, certain of our trading businesses
depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunities, and
decreases in volatility may reduce these opportunities and adversely affect
these businesses. 
 
-36-





 
LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Any change in volume
of executed transactions impacts both our costs incurred and revenues received
from those trades.
 
·                  Although we deploy various risk
mitigation and risk monitoring techniques, they are subject to judgments as to
the timing and duration of their application. Additionally, no risk management
procedure can anticipate every market event and the existence of risk
management in our businesses does not provide complete assurance against
incurring losses. Increased market volatility directly impacts our measurement
of risks. Increases to our measured risk may cause us to decrease our
proprietary positions or certain business activities. In such circumstances, we
may not be able to reduce our positions or our exposure in a timely,
cost-effective way or in a manner sufficient to offset the increase in measured
risk. For additional discussion on risk mitigation and risk monitoring
techniques, see Risk Management in this MD&A.
 
·                  Declines in the size and number of
underwritings and M&A transactions may have an adverse impact on our
results of operations and, if we are unable to reduce expenses, our profit
margins. An overall decrease in global markets appetites for transactions may
also impact our ability to syndicate various loan or equity commitments we have
made. Additionally, pricing and other competitive pressures may adversely
affect revenues for our Investment Banking segment.
 
·                  Asset valuations of our clients
portfolios are impacted by changes in equity market conditions or interest
rates. In turn, our fees for managing those portfolios are also affected.
Changing market conditions may cause investors to change their allocations of
investments in our funds or other products. Our asset management business
operates in a highly competitive environment. Changes in our asset management
business performance could result in a decline in AUM and in incentive and
management fees.
 
Credit Risk
 
We are exposed to the
potential for credit-related losses that can occur as a result of an
individual, counterparty or issuer who owes us money, securities or other
assets being unable or unwilling to honor its contractual obligations. We are
also at risk that our rights against any individual, counterparty or issuer may
not be enforceable in all circumstances. Additionally, deterioration in the
credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold could
result in losses or adversely affect our ability to otherwise use those
securities or obligations for liquidity purposes. The amount and duration of
our credit exposures have been increasing over the past several years, as have
the number and range of the entities to which we have credit exposures.
Although we regularly review credit exposures to specific clients and
counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regions that we
believe may present credit concerns, new business initiatives may cause us to transact
with a broader array of clients, with new asset classes and in new markets. In
addition, the recent widening of credit spreads and dislocations in the credit
markets have in some cases made it more difficult to syndicate credit
commitments to investors, and further widening of credit spreads or worsening
of these dislocations could increase these difficulties, resulting in increased
credit exposures.
 
Liquidity Risk
 
While our liquidity strategy seeks
to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all of our funding
obligations in all markets, our liquidity could be impaired by an inability to
access secured and/or unsecured debt markets, an inability to access funds from
our subsidiaries, an inability to sell assets or unforeseen outflows of cash or
collateral. This situation may arise due to circumstances that we are unable to
control, such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that
affects third parties or us. As we continue to employ structured products to
benefit our clients and ourselves, the financial instruments that we hold and
the contracts to which we are a party are becoming increasingly complex and
these complex structured products often do not have readily available markets
to access in times of liquidity stress. Growth of our principal investing
activities could further restrict liquidity for these positions. Further, our
ability to sell assets may be impaired if other market participants are seeking
to sell similar assets at the same time.
 
Our credit ratings are important to
our liquidity. A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our
liquidity and competitive position, increase our borrowing costs, limit our
access to the capital markets or trigger provisions under certain bilateral
provisions in some of our trading and collateralized financing contracts that
could permit counterparties to terminate contracts or require us to post
additional collateral. Termination of our trading and collateralized financing
contracts could cause us to sustain losses and impair our liquidity by
requiring us to find other sources of financing or to make significant cash
payments or securities movements.

BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Operational Risk
 
Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed
internal or outsourced processes, people, infrastructure and technology, or
from external events. Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process,
on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse
markets. These transactions have become increasingly complex and often must
adhere to requirements unique to each transaction, as well as legal and
regulatory standards. Although contingency plans exist, our ability to conduct
business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that
supports our business.
 
Legal, Regulatory and
Reputational Risk
 
The securities and financial services industries are subject to extensive
regulation under both federal and state laws in the U.S. as well as under the
laws of all of the other jurisdictions in which we do business. We are subject
to regulation in the U.S. by governmental agencies including the SEC and
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and outside the U.S. by various
international agencies including the Financial Services Authority in the United
Kingdom and the Financial Services Agency in Japan. We also are regulated by a
number of self-regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) (formed in 2007 by the consolidation of NASD, Inc.,
and the member regulation, enforcement and arbitration functions of the New
York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE)), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board and the National Futures Association, and by national securities and
commodities exchanges. Violation of applicable regulations could result in
legal and/or administrative proceedings, which may impose censures, fines,
cease-and-desist orders or suspension of a firm, its officers or employees.
 
The scrutiny of the
financial services industry has increased over the past several years, which
has led to increased regulatory investigations and litigation against financial
services firms. Legislation and rules adopted both in the U.S. and around
the world have imposed substantial new or more stringent regulations, internal
practices, capital requirements, procedures and controls and disclosure
requirements in such areas as financial reporting, corporate governance,
auditor independence, equity compensation plans, restrictions on the
interaction between equity research analysts and investment banking employees
and money laundering. The trend and scope of increased regulatory compliance
requirements have increased costs.
 
Our reputation is
critical in maintaining our relationships with clients, investors, regulators
and the general public, and is a key focus in our risk management efforts. In
recent years, there have been a number of highly publicized cases involving
fraud, conflicts of interest or other misconduct by employees in the financial
services industry, and we run the risk that misconduct by our employees could
occur, resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses. Employee misconduct
could also involve the improper use or disclosure of confidential information,
which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or
financial harm. In addition, in certain circumstances our reputation could be
damaged by activities of our clients in which we participate, or of hedge funds
or other entities in which we invest, over which we have little or no control.
 
We are involved in a
number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings concerning matters
arising in connection with the conduct of our business, including actions
brought against us and others with respect to transactions in which we acted as
an underwriter or financial advisor, actions arising out of our activities as a
broker or dealer in securities and actions brought on behalf of various classes
of claimants against many securities firms and lending institutions, including
us. See Part I, Item 1A, BusinessRegulation and Part I, Item 3, Legal
Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more information about legal and
regulatory matters.
 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

 
The following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that may
involve a higher degree of management judgment and in some instances complexity
in application. For a further discussion of these and other accounting
policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Use of Estimates
 
In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes,
management makes various estimates that
affect reported amounts and disclosures. Broadly, those estimates are used in:
 
·                  measuring fair value of certain financial
instruments;
 
·                  accounting for identifiable intangible assets and
goodwill;
 
-38-





 
LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
·                  establishing provisions for potential losses that
may arise from litigation, regulatory proceedings and tax examinations;
 
·                  assessing our ability to realize deferred taxes; and
 
·                  valuing equity-based compensation awards.
 
Estimates are based on available information and judgment. Therefore,
actual results could differ from our estimates and that difference could have a
material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.
 
Consolidation Policies
 
The assessment of whether accounting criteria for consolidation of an
entity is met requires management to exercise judgment. We consolidate the
entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. We
determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by
first determining whether the entity is a voting interest entity (sometimes
referred to as a non-VIE), a variable interest entity (VIE) or a qualified
special purpose entity (QSPE).
 
Voting Interest Entity. Voting interest entities are entities that have (i) total equity
investment at risk sufficient to fund expected future operations independently
and (ii) equity holders who have the obligation to absorb losses or
receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entitys
activities. In accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51,
Consolidated Financial Statements, and
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries, voting
interest entities are consolidated when the Company has a controlling financial
interest, typically more than 50 percent of an entitys voting interests.
 
Variable Interest Entity. VIEs are entities that
lack one or more voting interest entity characteristics. The Company
consolidates VIEs in which it is the primary beneficiary. In accordance with
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 46-R,
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
(revised December 2003)an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN
46(R)), we are the primary beneficiary if we have a variable interest, or a
combination of variable interests, that will either (i) absorb a majority
of the VIEs expected losses, (ii) receive a majority of the VIEs expected
residual returns, or (iii) both. To determine if we are the primary
beneficiary of a VIE, we review, among other factors, the VIEs design, capital
structure, contractual terms, which interests create or absorb variability and
related party relationships, if any. Additionally, we may calculate our share
of the VIEs expected losses and expected residual returns based upon the VIEs
contractual arrangements and/or our position in the VIEs capital structure.
This type of analysis is typically performed using expected cash flows
allocated to the expected losses and expected residual returns under various
probability-weighted scenarios.
 
Qualified Special Purpose Entity. QSPEs are passive entities with limited permitted
activities. SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers
and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities-a
replacement of FASB Statement No. 125 (SFAS 140), establishes
the criteria an entity must satisfy to be a QSPE, including types of assets
held, limits on asset sales, use of derivatives and financial guarantees, and
discretion exercised in servicing activities. In accordance with SFAS 140 and
FIN 46(R), we do not consolidate QSPEs.
 
For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs, QSPEs and other
entities see Note 6, Securitizations and Special Purpose Entities, to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Equity-Method Investments. Entities in which we do not have a controlling financial interest (and
therefore do not consolidate) but in which we exert significant influence
(generally defined as owning a voting interest of 20 percent to 50 percent, or
a partnership interest greater than 3 percent) are accounted for either under
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock or SFAS No. 159,
The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). For further discussion of our
adoption of SFAS 159, see Accounting and Regulatory DevelopmentsSFAS 159
below.
 
Other. When we
do not consolidate an entity or apply the equity method of accounting, we
present our investment in the entity at fair value. We have formed various
non-consolidated private equity or other alternative investment funds with
third-party investors that are typically organized as limited partnerships. We
typically act as general partner for these funds, and when third-party
investors have (i) rights to either remove the general partner without cause or
to liquidate the partnership; or (ii) substantive participation rights, we
do not consolidate these partnerships in accordance with Emerging Issue Task
Force (EITF) No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General
Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or
Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (EITF
04-5).
 
A determination of whether we have a controlling financial interest in an
entity and therefore our assessment of consolidation of that entity is
initially made at the time we become involved with the entity. Certain events
may occur which 
 
-39-





 
LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
cause us to re-assess our initial determination of whether an entity is a
VIE or non-VIE or whether we are the primary beneficiary if the entity is a VIE
and therefore our assessment of consolidation of that entity. Those events
generally are:
 
·                  The entitys governance structure is changed such
that either (i) the characteristics or adequacy of equity at risk are
changed, or (ii) expected returns or losses are reallocated among the
participating parties within the entity.
 
·                  The equity investment (or some part thereof) is
returned to the equity investors and other interests become exposed to expected
returns or losses.
 
·                  Additional activities are undertaken or assets
acquired by the entity that were beyond those anticipated previously.
 
·                  Participants in the entity acquire or sell interests
in the entity.
 
·                  The entity receives additional equity at risk or
curtails its activities in a way that changes the expected returns or losses.
 
Valuation of Financial
Instruments
 
We measure Financial instruments and other inventory
positions owned, excluding Real estate held for sale, and Financial instruments
and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased at fair value. We
account for Real estate held for sale at the lower of its carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell. Both realized and unrealized gains or losses from
Financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and Financial
instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased are
reflected in Principal transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
 
We adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements (SFAS 157), in the first quarter of 2007. SFAS 157
defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair
value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements.
Additionally and also in the first quarter of 2007, we adopted SFAS 159, and
applied this option to certain hybrid financial instruments not previously
accounted for at fair value under SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instrumentsan
amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140, as well as
certain deposit liabilities at our U.S. banking subsidiaries.
 
SFAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would
be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date, or an exit
price. The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial
instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability.
Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which
fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets
generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in
measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments rarely traded or not
quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation
models that require more judgment. Pricing observability is impacted by a
number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the
financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the
characteristics specific to the transaction and overall market conditions
generally.
 
The overall valuation process for financial
instruments may include adjustments to valuations derived from pricing models.
These adjustments may be made when, in managements judgment, either the size
of the position in the financial instrument or other features of the financial
instrument such as its complexity, or the market in which the financial
instrument is traded (such as counterparty, credit, concentration or liquidity)
require that an adjustment be made to the value derived from the pricing
models. An adjustment may be made if a trade of a financial instrument is
subject to sales restrictions that would result in a price less than the
computed fair value measurement from a quoted market price. Additionally, an
adjustment from the price derived from a model typically reflects managements
judgment that other participants in the market for the financial instrument
being measured at fair value would also consider such an adjustment in pricing
that same financial instrument.
 
We have categorized our financial instruments measured
at fair value into a three-level classification in accordance with SFAS 157.
Fair value measurements of financial instruments that use quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities are generally categorized as
Level I, and fair value measurements of financial instruments that have no
direct observable levels are generally categorized as Level III. The lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of a financial
instrument is used to categorize the instrument and reflects the judgment of
management. Financial assets and liabilities presented at fair value in
Holdings Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition generally are
categorized as follows:
 
Level I  Inputs are unadjusted,
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the
measurement date.
 
-40-





 
LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
The types of assets and liabilities
carried at Level I fair value generally are G-7 government and agency
securities, equities listed in active markets, investments in publicly traded
mutual funds with quoted market prices and listed derivatives.
 
Level II  Inputs (other than
quoted prices included in Level I) are either directly or indirectly observable
for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the
measurement date and for the duration of the instruments anticipated life.
 
Fair valued assets and liabilities
that are generally included in this category are non-G-7 government securities,
municipal bonds, certain hybrid financial instruments, certain mortgage and
asset backed securities, certain corporate debt, certain commitments and
guarantees, certain private equity investments and certain derivatives.
 
Level III  Inputs reflect
managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk
inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the
model.
 
Generally, assets and liabilities
carried at fair value and included in this category are certain mortgage and
asset-backed securities, certain corporate debt, certain private equity
investments, certain commitments and guarantees and certain derivatives.
 
Financial assets and liabilities presented at fair
value and categorized as Level III are generally those that are marked to model
using relevant empirical data to extrapolate an estimated fair value. The
models inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the instrument in a current period transaction and outcomes from the
models represent an exit price and expected future cash flows. Our valuation
models are calibrated to the market on a frequent basis. The parameters and
inputs are adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions.
Changes to inputs in valuation models are not changes to valuation
methodologies; rather, the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect
impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditions. Accordingly,
results from valuation models in one period may not be indicative of future
period measurements. Valuations are independently reviewed by employees outside
the business unit and, where applicable, valuations are back tested comparing
instruments sold to where they were marked.
 
During the 2007 fiscal year, our Level III assets
increased, ending the year at 13% of Financial instruments and other inventory
positions owned, measured at fair value and with our derivatives on a net
basis. The increase in Level III assets resulted largely from the
reclassification of approximately $11.4 billion of mortgage and asset-backed
securities, including approximately $5.3 billion in U.S. subprime residential
mortgage-related assets, previously categorized as Level II assets into the
Level III category. This reclassification generally occurred in the second half
of 2007, reflecting the reduction of liquidity in the capital markets that
resulted in a decrease in the observability of market prices. Approximately
half of the residential mortgage-related assets that were classified as Level III
at the end of the 2007 fiscal year were whole loan mortgages. In particular,
the decline in global trading activity impacted our ability to directly
correlate assumptions in valuation models used in pricing mortgage-related
assets, including those for cumulative loss rates and changes in underlying
collateral values to current market activity. Additionally and during the
fiscal year, the increase of assets characterized as Level III was also
attributable to the acquisition of private equity and other principal
investment assets, funded lending commitments that had not been fully
syndicated at the end of the fiscal year as well as certain commercial
mortgage-backed security positions.
 
For a further discussion regarding the measure of
Financial instruments and other inventory positions owned, excluding Real
estate held for sale, and Financial instruments and other inventory positions
sold but not yet purchased at fair value, see Note 4, Fair Value of Financial
Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill
 
Determining the carrying values and useful lives of certain assets
acquired and liabilities assumed associated with business acquisitions intangible
assets in particular requires significant judgment. At least annually, we are
required to assess whether goodwill and other intangible assets have been
impaired by comparing the estimated fair value, calculated based on
price-earnings multiples, of each business segment with its estimated net book
value, by estimating the amount of stockholders equity required to support
each business segment. Periodically estimating the fair value of a reporting
unit and carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite lives involves
significant judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and
assumptions. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on
whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of such a
charge. We completed our last impairment test on goodwill and other intangible
assets as of August 31, 2007, and no impairment was identified.

Legal, Regulatory and Tax Proceedings
 
In the normal course of
business, we have been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and other
legal and regulatory proceedings. Such proceedings include actions brought
against us and others with respect to transactions in which we acted as an
underwriter or financial advisor, actions arising out of our activities as a
broker or dealer in securities and commodities and actions brought on behalf of
various classes of claimants against many securities firms, including us. In
addition, our business activities are reviewed by various taxing authorities
around the world with regard to corporate income tax rules and
regulations. We provide for potential losses that may arise out of legal,
regulatory and tax proceedings to the extent such losses are probable and can
be estimated. Those determinations require significant judgment. For a further
discussion, see Note 9, Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Principal Transactions, Commissions and Net
Interest Revenue.
In both the Capital Markets
segment and the Private Investment Management business within the Investment
Management segment, we evaluate net revenue performance based on the aggregate
of Principal transactions, Commissions and Net interest revenue (Interest and
dividends revenue net of Interest expense). These revenue categories include
realized and unrealized gains and losses, commissions associated with client
transactions and the interest and dividend revenue and interest expense
associated

with financing or hedging positions. Interest and dividends revenue and
Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and
liabilities (primarily financial instruments owned and sold but not yet
purchased, and collateralized borrowing and lending activities), prevailing
interest rates and the term structure of our financings. Caution should be used
when analyzing these revenue categories individually because they may not be
indicative of the overall performance of the Capital Markets and Investment
Management business segments. Principal transactions, Commissions and Net
interest revenue in the aggregate rose 5% in 2007 from 2006 and 21% in 2006
from 2005.
 
2007 vs. 2006. Principal
transactions revenue decreased 6% in 2007 from 2006, primarily as a result of
negative valuation adjustments made on certain components of our Fixed Income
inventory during the second half of the 2007 fiscal year. Although we employ
risk mitigation strategies for certain inventory positions, correlations broke
down, particularly in the latter parts of the fiscal year, resulting in a
higher degree of risk incurred. With respect to Capital MarketsFixed Income
customer flow revenues, heightened risk aversion among investors caused many to
shift their trading activity to higher quality and more liquid products, which
are generally less profitable for the Firm. The negative adjustments and the
effects of this shift on our margin were partially offset by record revenues
within Capital MarketsEquities. The comparative increase in Equities
Principal transactions revenue was a result of higher customer activities,
increase in market volatility and higher revenues from principal and
proprietary trading strategies, especially in the international markets.
Commission revenues rose 21% in 2007 from 2006. The increase in 2007 reflected
growth in institutional commissions on higher global trading volumes. Net
interest revenue increased 68% in 2007 from 2006 reflecting changes in both
financing rates and yield curves between the periods. Interest and dividends
revenue and Interest expense rose 38% and 36%, respectively, in 2007 from 2006.
The comparative increase in Interest and dividend revenues and Interest expense
was attributable to the steepening of the yield curve and the growth of certain
assets and liabilities on our balance sheet.
 
2006 vs. 2005.
Principal transactions revenue improved 25% in 2006 from 2005, driven by broad
based strength across fixed income and equity products. Within Capital Markets,
the notable increases in 2006 were in credit products and commercial mortgages
and real estate. The 2006 increase in net revenues from Equities Capital
Markets reflected higher client trading volumes, increases in financing and
derivative activities and higher revenues from proprietary trading strategies.
Principal transactions revenue in 2006 also benefited from increased revenues
associated with certain structured products meeting the required market
observability standard for revenue recognition. Commission revenues rose 19% in
2006 from 2005, reflecting growth in institutional commissions on higher global
trading volumes, partially offset by lower commissions in our Investment
Management business segment, as certain clients transitioned from
transaction-based commissions to a traditional fee-based schedule. Net interest
revenue declined 8% in 2006 from 2005 as a result of a change in the mix of
asset composition, an increase in short-term U.S. financing rates, and a
flattened yield curve. Interest and dividends revenue and Interest expense rose
59% and 64%, respectively, in 2006 from 2005. The increase in Interest and
dividend revenues and Interest expense was attributable to higher short-term
interest rates coupled with higher levels of certain interest- and
dividend-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
 
Investment Banking. Investment banking revenues represent fees and commissions received for
underwriting public and private offerings of fixed income and equity
securities, fees and other revenues associated with advising clients on M&A
activities, as well as other corporate financing activities.
 
2007 vs. 2006.
Investment banking revenues rose to record levels in 2007, increasing 24% from
2006. Record Global FinanceDebt revenues increased 9% from 2006. Leveraged
finance revenues were at all time highs, resulting from a very strong first
half of the year, which was partially offset by a decline in the second half of
the year. Global FinanceEquity net revenues increased 25% compared to 2006 led
by exceptional derivative activity as well as strong initial public offering (IPO)
revenue in the first half of the fiscal year. Record Advisory Services revenues
increased 45% from 2006, as our completed transaction volume increased 124% for
the same period. Included in Investment banking revenue are client-driven
derivative and other capital markets-related transactions with Investment
Banking clients, which totaled approximately $541 million for 2007, compared to
approximately $304 million for 2006.
 
2006 vs. 2005.
Investment banking revenues rose in 2006, increasing 9% from 2005. Global
FinanceDebt 2006 net revenues increased 9% from 2005, reflecting significant
growth in global origination market volumes. Global FinanceEquity net revenues
decreased 1% compared to 2005, despite increased global origination market
volumes. Advisory Services net revenues increased 20% from 2005, reflecting
higher completed global M&A transaction volumes. Client-driven derivative and
other capital markets-related transactions with Investment Banking clients
totaled approximately $304 million for 2006, compared to approximately $308
million for 2005.
 
Asset Management and Other. Asset management and other revenues primarily
result from asset management activities in the Investment Management business
segment.

2007 vs. 2006. Asset
management and other revenues rose 23% in 2007 from 2006. The growth in 2007
primarily reflected higher asset management fees attributable to the growth in
AUM and management and incentive fees.
 
2006 vs. 2005. Asset
management and other revenues rose 50% in 2006 from 2005. The growth in 2006
primarily reflected higher asset management fees attributable to the growth in
AUM, a transition to fee-based rather than commission-based pricing for certain
clients, as well as higher private equity management and incentive fees.

Non-interest expenses were $13.2 billion, $11.7 billion and $9.8 billion
in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. A substantial portion of our non-interest
expenses is compensation-related, and a significant portion of our compensation
expense represents discretionary bonuses which are impacted by levels of
business activity and the structure of our share-based compensation programs.
Remaining non-interest expense categories are largely variable, and are
expected to change over time with revenue levels, business activity mix and
employee headcount levels.
 
Compensation
and benefits. Compensation and benefits totaled $9.5
billion, $8.7 billion and $7.2 billion in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.
Compensation and benefits expense includes both fixed and variable components.
Fixed compensation consists primarily of salaries, benefits and amortization of
previous years deferred equity awards. Variable compensation consists
primarily of incentive compensation and commissions. Compensation and benefits
expense as a percentage of net revenues was 49.3% for 2007, 2006 and 2005.
Employees totaled approximately 28,600, 25,900 and 22,900 at November 30,
2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
2007 vs. 2006.
Headcount increased 10% in 2007 from 2006, reflecting the increased levels of
business activity across the Firm as well as our continued investments in the
growth of the franchise, particularly in nonU.S. regions. In connection with
the announced restructuring of the Firms global residential mortgage
origination business, employee levels were reduced by approximately 1,900 in
the 2007 fiscal year. Fixed compensation in 2007 was 20% greater than 2006 as
result of the overall increase in employees. Fixed compensation was
approximately $4.6 billion and $3.9 billion in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The
2007 fixed compensation amount of approximately $4.6 billion includes
approximately $1.3 billion of amortization expense for stock awards granted in
prior periods. Variable compensation was 1% greater in 2007 than 2006.
 
2006 vs. 2005.
Headcount increased 13% in 2006 from 2005, reflecting the increased levels of
business activity across the Firm as well as our continued investments to grow
the franchise, particularly in nonU.S. regions. Correlated to the increase in
employees, fixed compensation in 2006 was 21% greater than 2005. Fixed
compensation was approximately $3.9 billion and $3.2 billion in 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The 2006 fixed compensation amount of approximately $3.9 billion
includes approximately $1.0 billion of amortization expense for stock awards
granted in prior periods. The increased level of revenue from 2005 to 2006
resulted in comparatively higher incentive compensation expense. Variable
compensation was 20% greater in 2006 than 2005.
 
Non-personnel expenses. Non-personnel expenses totaled $3.8 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.6
billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Non-personnel expenses as a
percentage of net revenues were 19.5%, 17.1%, and 17.7% in 2007, 2006, and
2005, respectively.
 
2007 vs. 2006.
Technology and communications expenses rose 18% in 2007 from 2006, reflecting
increased costs from the continued expansion and development of our Investment
Management platforms and infrastructure. Brokerage, clearance and distribution
fees rose 37% in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to higher transaction volumes in
Equities Capital Markets

and Investment Management products. Occupancy expenses increased 19% in
2007 from 2006, primarily due to increased space requirements from the
increased number of employees. Professional fees and business development
expenses increased 27% in 2007 on higher levels of business activity and
increased costs associated with recruiting, consulting and legal fees. In 2007,
Other non-personnel expenses included approximately $62 million associated with
the restructuring of the Firms global residential mortgage origination
business.
 
2006 vs. 2005.
Technology and communications expenses rose 17% in 2006 from 2005, reflecting
increased costs from the continued expansion and development of our Capital
Markets platforms and infrastructure. Brokerage, clearance and distribution
fees rose 15% in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to higher transaction volumes in
certain Capital Markets and Investment Management products. Occupancy expenses
increased 10% in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to increased space requirements
from the increased number of employees. Professional fees and business
development expenses increased 29% in 2006 on higher levels of business
activity and increased costs associated with recruiting, consulting and legal
fees.
 
Income Taxes
 
The provision for income taxes totaled $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion and
$1.6 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The provision for income
taxes resulted in effective tax rates of 30.3%, 32.9% and 32.5% for 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2007 compared
to 2006 was primarily due to a more favorable mix of earnings, which resulted
in lower tax expense from foreign operations as compared to the U.S. statutory
rate. The increases in the effective tax rates in 2006 and 2005 compared with
the prior years were primarily due to an increase in the level of pretax
earnings, which minimizes the impact of certain tax benefit items, and in 2006
a net reduction in certain benefits from foreign operations, partially offset
by a reduction in state and local taxes due to favorable audit settlements in
2006 and 2005.

Business Dispositions. During
the fiscal year, we completed the business dispositions listed below.
 
·                  Within
Capital Markets we disposed of Neuberger Bermans correspondent clearing
business, which decreased our goodwill and intangible assets by approximately
$26 million. The gain on sale was not material.
 
·                  We
incurred non-personnel costs of approximately $62 million, including a goodwill
write-down of approximately $27 million, and approximately $30 million of
severance expense (reported in Compensation and benefits), in connection with
the announced restructuring of the Firms global residential mortgage
origination business, including the closure of BNC Mortgage LLC, our U.S.
subprime residential mortgage origination platform, the rescaling of operations
in the U.S. and U.K. due to market conditions and product revisions and the
closure of our Korean mortgage business. The non-personnel costs were
approximately $22 million after-tax and were generally associated with
terminated leases.
 
·                  Lehman
Brothers Bank disposed of a leasing subsidiary, Dolphin Capital Corp., acquired
in the acquisition of Capital Crossing. The transaction was an asset sale and
amounts were transferred at approximately book value.
 
Strategic Investments. During the fiscal year, we made the following strategic investments.
 
·                  Acquired a 20% interest in the D.E. Shaw group, a
global investment management firm.
 
·                  Purchased an initial 20% interest and a subsequent
5% interest in both Spinnaker Asset Management Limited and Spinnaker Financial
Services, part of Spinnaker Capital, an emerging markets investment management
firm.
 
·                  Purchased a minority interest in Wilton Re Holdings,
a U.S. re-insurer that focuses on the reinsurance of mortality risk on life
insurance policies.
 
Subsequent to the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2007, we acquired certain assets of Van der Moolen
Specialists, including its book of NYSE-listed securities, staff and certain
technology. We and certain other broker-dealers entered into a joint-venture
and invested in TradeWeb Markets LLC, an electronic securities trading platform
owned by Thomson Financial. In addition, in January 2008, we sold our 20%
interest in Marble Bar Asset Management LLP, an investment management firm.
 
In January 2008, we announced
the suspension of our wholesale and correspondent mortgage lending activities
at our Aurora Loan Services subsidiary. We will continue to originate loans
through Auroras direct lending channel and will maintain Auroras servicing
business. As a result of these suspension activities, we estimate that we will
incur one-time expenses, after tax, of approximately $40 million for severance
and facilities exit costs.
 

Business Segments

 
Our operations are organized into three business segments:
 
·                  Capital Markets;
 
·                  Investment Banking; and
 
·                  Investment Management.
 
These business segments generate revenues from institutional, corporate,
government and high net worth individual clients across each of the revenue
categories in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Net revenues and expenses
contain certain internal allocations, such as funding costs, that are centrally
managed.

2007 vs. 2006. Net revenues totaled $12.3 billion and $12.0 billion in
2007 and 2006, respectively. Overall growth in 2007 Capital Markets net
revenues was driven by net revenues from the Equities component of Capital
Markets and a higher contribution from non-U.S. regions, partially offset by
declines in net revenues for the Fixed Income component of Capital Markets.
Capital Markets net revenues in 2007 include approximately $1.3 billion of
gains on debt liabilities which we elected to fair value under SFAS 157 and
SFAS 159. 
 
Net revenues in Capital MarketsFixed Income of $6.0 billion for 2007,
decreased 29% compared with $8.4 billion in 2006. Capital MarketsFixed Income
sales credit volumes were $4.8 billion, increasing 40% compared with $3.4
billion in 2006.
 
The businesses within the Fixed Income component of Capital Markets were
the most affected by the market dislocations, risk repricing and de-levering
that took place during the second half of the fiscal year. The adverse
conditions in the U.S. housing market, changes in the credit markets and
continued correction in leveraged loan pricing and certain asset-backed
security market segments were generally responsible for the negative variance
in Capital MarketsFixed Income revenues between the benchmark periods. The
negative valuation adjustments resulting from the impact of adverse market
conditions were partially mitigated by the economic risk management strategies
we employed as well as valuation changes on certain debt liabilities and
realized gains from the sale of certain leveraged lending positions in the
fourth quarter.
 
The table below presents certain components that generally contributed to
the decline of Capital MarketsFixed Income revenues in 2007 from 2006. These
components are presented on a gross basis, as well as a net basis. The net
impact represents the revenue impact from the components after adjusting for
the impact of certain economic risk management strategies. Caution should be
utilized when evaluating the amounts in the following table as they represent
only certain components of revenue associated with the general business
activities described.

(1)              The net impact represents the
remaining impact from the components after deducting the impact of certain
economic risk management strategies. The gross impact excludes any effect of
economic risk management strategies.
(2)              These valuation adjustments
substantially relate to asset-backed collateralized debt obligations including
warehoused positions.
(3)              Includes approximately $0.3 billion
of realized gains from the sale of certain leveraged lending positions that
were recognized in our fiscal fourth quarter. The net amount includes certain
transaction fees earned, in addition to the impact of certain economic risk
management strategies.
(4)              Represents the amount of gains on
debt liabilities allocated to Capital MarketsFixed Income and for which we
elected to fair value under SFAS 157 and SFAS 159. These gains represent the
effect of changes in our credit spread and exclude any Interest income or
expense as well as any gain or loss from the embedded derivative components of
these instruments. Changes in valuations are allocated to the businesses within
Capital MarketsFixed Income in relation to the cash generated by, or funding
requirements of, the underlying positions.
Capital MarketsEquities net revenues of $6.3 billion for 2007, increased
76% compared with $3.6 billion in 2006. These results reflected the higher revenue
levels reflecting the broader customer franchise developed globally. Capital
MarketsEquities sales credit volumes were $3.7 billion, increasing 53%
compared with $2.4 billion in 2006. Global market trading volumes rose 29% in
2007 compared to 2006.
 
The increase in Capital MarketsEquities net revenues reflected increased
performance during the fiscal year across all products, with the exception of
convertibles, driven by record customer activity and profitable principal
trading and investing strategies. Global equity markets advanced year over
year. In the latter half of our 2007 fiscal year, volatility was at higher
levels relative to the comparable 2006 period. The volatility in the global
equity markets led investors to employ risk mitigation strategies, driving
global market demand for and strong customer activity in cash and derivative
products. 2007 revenues in convertibles declined compared to 2006, mainly due
to unprofitable proprietary trading strategies in certain sectors. Capital
MarketsEquities prime services net revenues increased compared to those in
the 2006 fiscal year. At the end of the 2007 fiscal year, the number of our
prime brokerage services clients increased 20% to 630 from the end of the 2006
fiscal year. Correspondingly, overall client balances were 30% higher at the
end of the 2007 fiscal year also compared to balances at the end of the 2006
fiscal year. Capital MarketsEquities revenues in the 2007 fiscal year include
gains of approximately $700 million from private equity and other principal
investments, including our investment in GLG Partners LP, as well as
approximately $400 million in allocated gains from valuation changes in certain
of our debt liabilities carried at fair value pursuant to SFAS 157 and SFAS
159.
 
Net interest revenues for the Capital Markets segment in 2007 increased
68% compared to 2006, primarily attributable to higher short-term U.S.
financing rates and a change in the mix of asset composition. Interest and
dividends revenue rose 38% in 2007 compared to 2006, and interest expense rose
36% in 2007 compared to the corresponding 2006 period. Non-interest expenses
for 2007 increased 11%. Technology and communications expenses increased due to
the continued expansion and development of our business platforms and
infrastructure. Brokerage, clearance and distribution fees rose primarily due
to higher transaction volumes across most Capital Markets products.
Professional fees and business development expenses increased due to global
growth of the business segment. For the Capital Markets segment, Income before
taxes for 2007 decreased 11% compared with 2006 and, correspondingly, pre-tax
margins in 2007 were 34% compared to 39% in 2006. During 2007, we announced
steps to restructure our residential mortgage origination business, which is a
component of our securitized products business within Capital MarketsFixed
Income. See Business Acquisitions and DispositionsBusiness Dispositions
above. The costs associated with these steps are included in the above non interest
expenses.
 
2006 vs. 2005. Capital Markets net revenues increased to $12.0 billion
in 2006 from $9.8 billion in 2005, reflecting record performances in both Fixed
Income and Equities. On strong performances across most products, Capital
MarketsFixed Income net revenues increased 15% in 2006 from 2005 and Capital
MarketsEquities net revenues increased 44% over the same period. Income before
taxes totaled $4.7 billion and $3.6 billion in 2006 and 2005, respectively, up
32%. Pre-tax margin was 39% and 36% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
Our Capital MarketsFixed Income net revenues grew to a record $8.4
billion in 2006, an increase of 15% from 2005. This growth was attributable to
strong client-flow activity and profitable trading strategies, leading to
record revenues in

most products. The products that contributed most to the increase in
revenues year over year included credit, commercial mortgages and real estate
and prime brokerage, partially offset by strong, but lower revenues in both
interest rate products and residential mortgages.
 
Capital MarketsEquities net revenues increased 44% to a record level in
2006 on strong client-flow and robust global trading volumes. Global equity
indices were up 14% in local currency terms for 2006, helped by strong earnings
reports, lower energy prices and the end to the interest rate tightening cycle
by central banks. Substantially all equity products in 2006 surpassed their
2005 performance, including gains in cash products, prime brokerage, equity
derivatives, convertibles and proprietary and principal activities.
 
Net interest revenues decreased 4% in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to
higher short-term U.S. interest rates, a flattened yield curve and a change in
mix of asset composition. Interest and dividends revenue and Interest expense
increased 59% and 64%, respectively, in 2006 from 2005 as a result of higher
short-term interest rates coupled with higher levels of interest- and
dividend-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Non-interest expenses
increased to $7.3 billion in 2006 from $6.2 billion in 2005. The growth in Non-interest
expenses reflected higher compensation and benefits expense related to improved
performance as well as increased technology, occupancy and communications
expenses attributable to continued investments in trading platforms,
integration of business acquisitions, and higher brokerage and clearance costs
and professional fees from increased business activities.

2007 vs. 2006. Investment Banking net revenues totaled $3.9 billion and
$3.2 billion in 2007 and 2006, respectively, an increase of 24% in 2007 from
2006, reflecting record revenues for Global FinanceDebt, Global FinanceEquity
and Advisory Services and a generally higher level of cross-border and
international business activity. Non-interest expenses rose 15% in 2007 from
2006. This increase was attributable to an increase in compensation and
benefits expense related to an increased number of employees and higher
Non-personnel expenses. Income before taxes increased 55% in 2007 to $1.0
billion from $660 million in 2006, and, correspondingly, pre-tax margins in
2007 were 26% compared to 21% in 2006.
 
Global FinanceDebt origination net revenues were $1.6 billion in 2007,
increasing 9% from 2006. These results were driven, in part, by revenues from
leveraged finance which had a record first half of 2007 but fell significantly
in the latter half of 2007 as a number of financial sponsor-related
transactions were cancelled or delayed, particularly in the leveraged loan
market. These conditions also caused certain lending commitments to be executed
at lower fee levels. Publicly reported global debt origination market volumes
decreased 3% in 2007 over 2006, with our origination market volumes decreasing
16% over the same period. Our debt origination fee backlog of $141 million at November 30,
2007 decreased 43% from November 30, 2006. Debt origination backlog may
not be indicative of the level of future business due to the frequent use of
the shelf registration process and changes in overall market conditions. For
the calendar year 2007, our market ranking for publicly reported global debt
origination was sixth with a 5.4% share, down from a rank of fourth with a 6.2%
share in calendar year 2006.
 
Global FinanceEquity net revenues increased 25% in 2007 to a record $1.0
billion from 2006 revenues of $815 million, consistent with a 23% increase in
industry-wide global equity origination market volumes. The increase in 2007 net
revenues also included strong, customer-driven derivative-related activity,
which more than doubled from 2006 levels. On a sequential year basis, net
revenues associated with private placement transactions and accelerated stock
repurchases increased 72%. IPO net revenues increased 38% compared to the 2006
fiscal year and IPO net revenues increased within all geographic segments. Our
IPO market volume for 2007 increased 17% compared to fiscal year 2006, slightly
lower than the 19% market increase. Our equity-related fee backlog (for both
filed and unfiled transactions) at November 30, 2007 was approximately
$316 million, up 11% from November 30, 2006; however, that measure may not
be indicative of the level of future business depending on changes in overall
market conditions. For the calendar year 2007, our market ranking for publicly
reported global equity origination was ninth with a 3.0% share, consistent with
our rank in calendar year 2006 during which we had a 3.5% market share.
 
Advisory Services revenues were a record $1.3 billion in 2007, up 45% from
then-record revenues in 2006. Industry-wide completed and announced transaction
volumes increased 32% and 27%, respectively, in 2007 from 2006, while our
completed and announced volumes increased 124% and 49%, respectively, in the
same comparative period. Our global market share for publicly reported
completed and announced transactions increased to 21% and 17%, respectively,
for calendar 2007, up 16% for both measures, in calendar year 2006. Our M&A
fee backlog at November 30, 2007 was $374 million, up 54% from November 30,
2006; however, that measure may not be indicative of the level of future
business depending on changes in overall market conditions. For the calendar
year 2007, our market ranking for completed transactions was sixth with a 20.9%
share, up from a rank of seventh with a 15.8% share in calendar year 2006. Our
market
 

1                    Debt and equity
underwriting volumes as reported by Thomson Financial, an operating unit of The
Thomson Corporation., are based on full credit for single-book managers and
equal credit for joint-book managers. Debt underwriting volumes include both
publicly registered and Rule 144A issues of high grade and high yield
bonds, sovereign, agency and taxable municipal debt, non-convertible preferred
stock and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. Equity underwriting volumes
include both publicly registered and Rule 144A issues of common stock and
convertibles. Because publicly reported debt and equity underwriting volumes do
not necessarily correspond to the amount of securities actually underwritten
and do not include certain private placements and other transactions, and
because revenue rates vary among transactions, publicly reported debt and
equity underwriting volumes may not be indicative of revenues in a given
period. Additionally, because Advisory Services volumes are based on full
credit to each of the advisors in a transaction, and because revenue rates vary
among transactions, Advisory Services volumes may not be indicative of revenues
in a given period.

ranking for announced transactions was ninth with a 17.3% share, down from
a rank of eighth with a 15.5% share in calendar year 2006.
 
2006 vs. 2005. Investment banking revenues totaled $3.2 billion and $2.9
billion in 2006 and 2005, respectively, representing a 9% increase from the
prior fiscal year. Non-interest expenses rose 23% in 2006 from 2005,
attributable to an increase in compensation and benefits expense related to an
increased number of employees and higher revenues, as well as higher
non-personnel expenses from increased business activity. As a result, income
before taxes declined 23% in 2006 to $660 million from $855 million in 2005.
 
Global FinanceDebt revenues were a record $1.4 billion in 2006,
increasing 9% over 2005 as investors took advantage of continued low interest
rates, tight credit spreads and a flattened yield curve. Revenues also
increased significantly over 2005 on relatively flat volumes due to higher
margins on several large transactions. Partially offsetting these factors was a
lower level of client-driven derivative and other capital marketsrelated
transactions with our investment banking clients which totaled $222 million in
2006, compared with $318 million in 2005. Publicly reported global debt
origination market volumes increased 17% in 2006 over 2005, with our origination
market volumes increasing 8% over the same period. Our debt origination fee
backlog of $245 million at November 30, 2006 increased 13% from November 30,
2005. For the calendar year 2006, our market ranking for publicly reported
global debt originations was fourth with a 6.2% share, down from a rank of
third with a 6.7% share in calendar year 2005.
 
Global FinanceEquity revenues declined 1% in 2006 to $815 million from
record 2005 revenues, despite a 35% increase in industry-wide global equity
origination market volumes. Revenues in 2006 reflected strength in IPO
activities, offset by lower revenues from the Asia region, which benefited from
several large transactions in 2005. Our IPO market volume for 2006 increased
25% from fiscal year 2005, compared to the overall markets increase of 63%.
Our equity-related fee backlog (for both filed and unfiled transactions) at November 30,
2006 was approximately $286 million. Our market share for publicly reported
global equity underwriting transactions decreased to 3.5% in calendar 2006 from
4.8% for calendar year 2005.
 
Advisory Services revenues were $921 million in 2006, up 20% from 2005.
Industry-wide completed and announced transaction volumes increased 31% and
34%, respectively, in 2006 from 2005, while our completed and announced volumes
increased 21% and 27%, respectively, from the same comparative period. M&A
volumes rose during the period due to increasing equity markets, strong
corporate profitability and balance sheets, and available capital raised by financial
sponsors. Our global market share for publicly reported completed transactions
increased to 15.8% for calendar 2006, up from 13.4% in calendar year 2005. Our
M&A fee backlog at November 30, 2006 was $243 million down 1% from November 30,
2005.

2007 vs. 2006. Investment Management net revenues ended the fiscal year
up 28% compared to 2006, as Asset Management and Private Investment Management
both achieved record results in 2007. Non-interest expense of $2.3 billion for
2007 increased 22% compared with 2006, resulting from higher levels of
discretionary compensation resulting from increased net revenues and numbers of
employees. Non-personnel expenses also increased, primarily due to higher
brokerage, clearing, exchange and distribution fees. The continued expansion of
this business platform globally contributed to the comparative increases in
Non-interest and Non-personnel expenses. Income before taxes of $791 million
increased 51% compared with 2006. In part, this increase was reflective of
higher pre-tax margins associated with revenue generated

from minority stake investments in alternative asset managers. Pre-tax
margins in 2007 were 26% compared to 22% in 2006.
 
Asset Management net revenues of $1.9 billion in 2007 increased by 31%
from 2006, reflecting significantly higher management fees, principally due to
strong growth in AUM, and higher incentive fees. During the fiscal year, AUM
increased $57 billion or 25% to approximately $282 billion. 72% of the increase
was a result of net inflows across all asset categories.
 
Private Investment Management net revenues of $1.2 billion increased 24%
in 2007 from 2006, driven both by higher equity-related activity, especially
within the volatility and cash businesses, and higher fixed income-related
activity, especially in credit products, securitized products and global rates
business. Fixed income-related activity in the second half of the fiscal year
slowed as clients became less active in fixed income-related products as a
result of higher volatility in the global markets and credit concerns in
certain asset classes.
 
2006 vs. 2005. Net revenues totaled $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion in 2006
and 2005, respectively, representing a 25% increase, as both Asset Management
and Private Investment Management achieved then record results in 2006.
Non-interest expenses totaled $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion in 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The 24% increase in Non-interest expense was driven by higher
compensation and benefits associated with a higher level of earnings and
headcount, as well as increased Non-personnel expenses from continued expansion
of the business, especially into nonU.S. regions. Income before taxes
increased 31% in 2006 to $525 million from $402 million in 2005. Pre-tax margin
was 22% and 21% in 2006 and 2005, respectively.
 
Asset Management net revenues of $1.4 billion in 2006 increased by 40%
from 2005, driven by a 29% increase in AUM and strong revenues from our growing
alternative investment offerings, which contributed higher incentive fees in
2006 compared to 2005. AUM increased to a record $225 billion at November 30,
2006, up from $175 billion at November 30, 2005, with 70% of the increase
resulting from net inflows.
 
Private Investment Management net revenues of $985 million increased 9% in
2006 from 2005, driven by higher equity-related activity, especially within the
volatility and cash businesses. Fixed income-related activity was relatively
flat in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of clients asset reallocations into
equity products.
 

Geographic Revenues

 
We organize our operations into three geographic regions:
 
·                  Europe and the Middle
East, inclusive of our operations in Russia and Turkey;
 
·                  Asia-Pacific,
inclusive of our operations in Australia and India; and
 
·                  the Americas.
 
Net revenues presented by geographic region are based upon the location of
the senior coverage banker or investment advisor in the case of Investment
Banking or Asset Management, respectively, or where the position was risk
managed within Capital Markets and Private Investment Management. Certain
revenues associated with U.S. products and services that result from
relationships with international clients have been classified as international
revenues using an allocation process. In addition, expenses contain certain
internal allocations, such as regional transfer pricing, which are centrally
managed. The methodology for allocating the firms revenues and expenses to
geographic regions is dependent on the judgment of management.

The below charts illustrate the contribution percentage of each geographic
region to our total net revenues.
 













 
2007 vs. 2006. Non-Americas net revenues rose 49% in 2007 from 2006 to a
record $9.4 billion, representing 49% of total net revenues in 2007 and 36% in
2006. The increase in 2007 net revenues was due to the continued growth in
Capital Markets as well as the continued expansion of our Investment Management
business in both the Europe and the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific regions.
Non-U.S. net revenues represented 50% and 37% of total net revenues for the
2007 and 2006 fiscal years.
 
Net revenues in Europe and the Middle East rose 39% in 2007 from 2006,
reflecting record performance in Capital MarketsEquities, Investment Banking
and Investment Management. In Capital MarketsEquities, higher revenues were
driven by improved risk and trading strategies, as well as record customer flow
activity, increased volume and gains from principal investment activities. In
Investment Banking, higher net revenues reflected record results in leveraged
finance revenue and advisory revenue, as well as equity origination. In
Investment Management, higher net revenues reflected a significant increase in
AUM. Income before taxes for Europe and the Middle East increased 68%.
 
Net revenues in Asia-Pacific rose 74% in 2007 from 2006, reflecting strong
performance in all business segments. Capital Markets results were driven by
strong performances in execution services and volatility based upon strong
customer-demand as Asian equity markets outperformed other regions in the fiscal
year. Investment Banking results were driven by strong IPO activity and
debt-related transactions. Investment Management results are reflective of our
continued development of this business segment in this geographic sector.
Income before taxes for Asia-Pacific increased 113%.

2006 vs. 2005. NonAmericas net revenues rose 21% in 2006 from 2005 to
$6.3 billion, representing 36% of total net revenues both in 2006 and 2005. The
increase in 2006 net revenues was due to the continued growth in Capital
Markets as well as the continued expansion of our Investment Management
business in both Europe and Asia. Net revenues in Europe and the Middle East
rose 26% in 2006 from 2005, reflective of higher revenues in Capital Markets,
growth in Investment Management and strong results in Investment Banking. In
Capital MarketsFixed Income, higher revenues were driven by credit products,
securitized products and our real estate business. In Capital MarketsEquities,
higher net revenues reflect strong results in equity derivatives and equity
prime brokerage services. Income before taxes for Europe and the Middle East
increased 35%. Net revenues in Asia-Pacific rose 10% in 2006 from 2005,
reflective of higher revenues in Capital Markets and the growth in Investment
Management, partially offset by declining revenues in Investment Banking.
Capital Markets net revenues increased in 2006 primarily from strong
performances in commercial mortgages and real estate, equity derivatives and
improved equity trading strategies, partially offset by lower revenues from
interest rate products. Income before taxes for Asia-Pacific decreased 21%.
 

Liquidity, Funding and Capital Resources

 
We establish and monitor compliance with guidelines for the level and
composition of our liquidity pool and asset funding, the makeup and size of our
balance sheet and the utilization of our equity.
 
During the latter half of our 2007 fiscal year, the global capital markets
experienced a significant contraction in available liquidity as the adverse
market environment experienced in our third quarter continued into our fourth
quarter and deteriorated further in November 2007. Despite infusions of
liquidity by central banks into the financial system, broad asset classes,
particularly U.S. subprime residential mortgages and structured credit
products, remained thinly traded throughout this period. Notwithstanding these
global market conditions, we ended the period with a very strong liquidity
position. At November 30, 2007, our liquidity pool was approximately $35
billion, up from approximately $31 billion at November 30, 2006 and down
slightly from approximately $36 billion at the end of the third quarter of the
2007 fiscal year. Long-term capital (long-term borrowings, excluding borrowings
with remaining contractual maturities within twelve months of the financial
statement date, and total stockholders equity) was at approximately $146
billion at the end of 2007 fiscal year, up from approximately $100 billion at November 30,
2006 and $142 billion at the end of the third quarter of the 2007 fiscal year.
Also during 2007, Holdings and LBIs credit ratings were upgraded by two
credit rating agencies.
 
Liquidity
 
Liquidity pool. We maintain a liquidity pool
available to Holdings that covers expected cash outflows for twelve months in a
stressed liquidity environment. In assessing the required size of our liquidity
pool, we assume that assets outside the liquidity pool cannot be sold to
generate cash, unsecured debt cannot be issued, and any cash and unencumbered
liquid collateral outside of the liquidity pool cannot be used to support the
liquidity of Holdings. Our liquidity pool is sized to cover expected cash
outflows associated with the following items:
 
·                  The repayment of approximately $21.5 billion of unsecured debt, which
is all of the unsecured debt maturing in the next twelve months issued by
Holdings and our unregulated entities, excluding approximately $3.7 billion of
structured note self-funding trades that are measured at fair value and managed
by business units through matched, unencumbered asset portfolios outside of
Holdings liquidity pool. Our regulated entities each maintain their own
liquidity pool sized to cover the repayment of the approximately $2.3 billion
in aggregate of unsecured debt maturing in the next twelve months issued by
those regulated entities.
 
·                  The funding of commitments to extend credit made by Holdings and
certain unregulated subsidiaries based on a probabilistic model. The funding of
commitments to extend credit made by our regulated subsidiaries (including our
banks) is covered by the liquidity pools maintained by these regulated
subsidiaries. For additional information, see Contractual Obligations and
Lending-Related Commitments below and Note 9, Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
·                  The anticipated impact of adverse changes on secured funding  either
in the form of a greater difference between the market and pledge value of
assets (also known as haircuts) or in the form of reduced borrowing
availability.
 
·                  The anticipated funding requirements of equity repurchases as we manage
our equity base (including offsetting the dilutive effect of our employee
incentive plans). See Equity Management below.
 
In addition, the
liquidity pool is sized to cover the impact of a one notch downgrade of
Holdings long-term debt ratings, including the additional collateral that
would be required to be posted against derivative contracts and other

secured funding
arrangements. See Credit Ratings below.
 
The liquidity pool is
invested in liquid instruments, including cash equivalents, G-7 government
bonds and U.S. agency securities, investment grade asset-backed securities and
other liquid securities that we believe have a highly reliable pledge value. We
calculate our liquidity pool on a daily basis.
 
Our estimated values of
the liquidity pool and other unencumbered (i.e.,
unpledged) asset portfolios available are:

(1)              Our regulated subsidiaries, such as our
U.S. and non-U.S. broker-dealers and bank entities, maintain their own
liquidity pools to cover their stand-alone expected annualized cash funding
needs in a stressed liquidity environment. Unencumbered assets in regulated
entities are generally restricted from transfer and therefore considered not
available to support the liquidity needs of Holdings or other unregulated
entities.
(2)     Our deposit-taking bank entities consist of two U.S.
institutions and one in Germany.
Funding of assets. We fund assets based
on their liquidity characteristics, and utilize cash capital1 to
provide financing for our long-term funding needs. Our funding strategy
incorporates the following factors:
 
·                  Liquid assets (i.e., assets for which we believe a reliable secured funding
market exists across all market environments including government bonds, U.S.
agency securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities and equity
securities) are primarily funded on a secured basis.
 
·                  Secured funding haircuts
are funded with cash capital.
 
·                  Illiquid assets (e.g., fixed
assets, intangible assets and margin postings) and less liquid inventory
positions (e.g., derivatives, private equity
investments, certain corporate loans, certain commercial mortgages and real
estate positions) are funded with cash capital.
 
·                  Certain unencumbered assets that are not part of the liquidity pool
irrespective of asset quality are also funded with cash capital. These assets
are typically unencumbered because of operational and asset-specific factors (e.g., securities moving between depots). We do not assume a
change in these factors during a stressed liquidity event.
 
As part of our funding
strategy, we also take steps to mitigate our main sources of contingent
liquidity risk as follows:
 
·                  Commitments to extend credit  Cash capital is utilized to cover a probabilistic
estimate of expected funding of commitments to extend credit. For a further
discussion of our commitments, see Contractual Obligations and Lending-Related
Commitments in this MD&A and Note 9, Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
·                  Ratings downgrade  Cash capital is utilized to cover the liquidity
impact of a one-notch downgrade on Holdings. A ratings downgrade would increase
the amount of collateral to be posted against our derivative contracts and
other secured funding arrangements. For a further discussion of credit ratings
and the potential impacts of ratings downgrades, see Credit Ratings below.
 
·                  Client financing  We provide secured financing to our clients typically
through repurchase and prime broker agreements. These financing activities can
create liquidity risk if the availability and terms of our own secured
borrowing agreements adversely change during a stressed liquidity event and we
are unable to reflect these changes in our client financing agreements. We
mitigate this risk by entering into term secured borrowing 
 

1                   Cash capital consists of
stockholders equity, the estimated sustainable portion of core deposit
liabilities at our bank subsidiaries, and liabilities with remaining term of
one year or more.

agreements, in which we can fund different types of
collateral at pre-determined collateralization levels, and by maintaining
liquidity pools at our regulated broker-dealers.
 
Our policy is to operate
with an excess of long-term funding sources over our long-term funding
requirements (cash capital surplus). We seek to maintain a cash capital surplus
at Holdings of at least $2.0 billion. As of November 30, 2007, our cash
capital surplus at Holdings increased to $8.0 billion, up from $6.0 billion at November 30,
2006. Additionally, at November 30, 2007 and 2006, our cash capital
surplus in our regulated entities was approximately $12.6 billion and $10.0
billion, respectively.
 
We hedge the majority of
foreign exchange risk associated with investments in subsidiaries in non-U.S.
dollar currencies using foreign currency-denominated long-term debt and
forwards.
 
Diversification of funding sources. We seek to diversify our funding sources. We issue
long-term debt in multiple currencies and across a wide range of maturities to
tap many investor bases, thereby reducing our reliance on any one source.
 
·                  During 2007, we issued $86.3 billion of long-term
borrowings. Long-term borrowings (less current portion) increased to $123.2
billion at November 30, 2007, up from $81.2 billion at November 30,
2006 principally to support the growth in our assets as well as to pre-fund a
portion of our 2008 maturities. The weighted-average maturities of our
long-term borrowings were 7.1 and 6.3 years at November 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.
 
·                  We diversify our issuances geographically to minimize
refinancing risk and broaden our debt-holder base. As of November 30,
2007, 54% of our long-term debt was issued outside the United States. In
comparison, as of November 30, 2006, 49% of our long-term debt was issued
outside the United States.
 
·                  In order to minimize refinancing risk, we establish
limits (stated as percentages of outstanding long-term borrowings) on our
long-term borrowings anticipated to mature within any quarterly (12.5%),
half-year (17.5%) and full-year (30.0%) interval. At November 30, 2007,
those limits were $15.4 billion, $21.6 billion and $37.0 billion, respectively.
If we were to operate with debt above these levels, we would not include the
additional amount as a source of cash capital.
 
·                  We typically issue in sufficient size to create a
liquid benchmark issuance (i.e.,
sufficient size to be included in the Lehman Bond Index, a widely used index
for fixed income asset managers).
 
Long-term debt is
accounted for in our long-term-borrowings maturity profile at its contractual
maturity date if the debt is redeemable at our option. Long-term debt that is
repayable at par at the holders option is included in these limits at its
earliest redemption date. Extendible issuances (which mature on an initial
specified maturity date, unless the debt holders elect to extend the term of
the note for a period specified in the note) are included in these limits at
their earliest maturity date.

The quarterly long-term borrowings
maturity schedule over the next five years at November 30, 2007 is as
follows:
 
Long-Term
Borrowings Maturity Profile Chart(1)
 

(1)             Included in long-term
debt is $5.1 billion of certain hybrid
financial instruments with contingent early redemption features linked to market prices or other
triggering events (e.g., the
downgrade of a reference obligation underlying a creditlinked note). In the
above maturity table, these notes are shown at their contractual maturity. In
determining the cash capital value of these notes, however, we excluded the
portion reasonably expected to mature within twelve months ($2.2 billion) from our cash capital
sources at November 30, 2007.
 
·               We use both committed
and uncommitted bilateral and syndicated long-term bank facilities to
complement our long-term debt issuance. In particular, Holdings maintains a
$2.0 billion unsecured, committed revolving credit agreement with a syndicate
of banks that expires in February 2009. In addition, we maintain a $2.5
billion multi-currency unsecured, committed revolving credit facility (European
Facility) with a syndicate of banks for Lehman Brothers Bankhaus AG (Bankhaus)
and Lehman Brothers Treasury Co. B.V. that expires in April 2010. Our
ability to borrow under such facilities is conditioned on complying with
customary lending conditions and covenants. We have maintained compliance with
the material covenants under these credit agreements at all times. We draw on
both of these facilities from time to time in the normal course of conducting
our business. As of November 30, 2007, there were no outstanding
borrowings against either Holdings credit facility or the European Facility.
 
·               We have established a
$2.4 billion conduit that issues secured liquidity notes to pre-fund high grade
loan commitments. This is fully backed by a triple-A rated, third-party,
one-year revolving liquidity back stop, which we have in turn fully backed.
This conduit is consolidated in Holdings results of operations.
 
·               We participate in an
A-1/P-1-rated multi-seller conduit. This multi-seller issues secured liquidity
notes to provide financing. We use this conduit for purposes of funding a
portion of our contingent acquisition commitments. At November 30, 2007,
we were contingently committed to providing $1.6 billion of liquidity if the
conduit is unable to remarket the secured liquidity notes upon their maturity,
generally, one year after a failed remarketing event. This conduit is not
consolidated in Holdings results of operations.

·                  We own three bank entities: Lehman
Brothers Bank, a U.S.-based thrift institution, Lehman Brothers Commercial
Bank, a U.S.-based industrial bank, and Bankhaus. These regulated bank entities
operate in a deposit-protected environment and are able to source low-cost
unsecured funds that are primarily term deposits. These bank
entities are generally insulated from a company-specific or market liquidity
event, thereby providing a reliable funding source for their mortgage products
and selected loan assets and increasing our consolidated funding
diversification. Overall, these bank entities have raised $29.4 billion and
$21.4 billion of customer deposit liabilities as of November 30, 2007 and
2006, respectively.
 
·                  Bank facilities provide us with further
diversification and flexibility. For example, we draw on our committed
syndicated credit facilities described above on a regular basis (typically 25%
to 50% of the time on a weighted-average basis) to provide us with additional
sources of long-term funding on an as-needed basis. We have the ability to
prepay and redraw any number of times and to retain the proceeds for any term
up to the maturity date of the facility. As a result, we see these facilities
as having the same liquidity value as long-term borrowings with the same
maturity dates, and we include these borrowings in our reported long-term
borrowings at the facilitys stated final maturity date to the extent that they
are outstanding as of a reporting date.
 
Funding action plan. We have developed and regularly update a Funding
Action Plan, which represents a detailed action plan to manage a stress
liquidity event, including a communication plan for regulators, creditors,
investors and clients. The Funding Action Plan considers two types of liquidity
stress eventsa Company-specific event, where there are no issues with overall
market liquidity and a broader market-wide event, which affects not just our
Company but the entire market.
 
In a Company-specific event, we assume we would lose access to the
unsecured funding market for a full year and have to rely on the liquidity pool
available to Holdings to cover expected cash outflows over the next twelve
months.
 
In a market liquidity event, in addition to the pressure of a
Company-specific event, we also assume that, because the event is market wide,
additional counterparties to whom we have extended liquidity facilities draw on
these facilities. To mitigate the effect of a market liquidity event, we have
developed access to additional liquidity sources beyond the liquidity pool at
Holdings, including unutilized funding capacity in our bank entities and
unutilized capacity in our bank facilities. See Funding of assets above.
 
We perform regular assessments of our funding requirements in stress
liquidity scenarios to best ensure we can meet all our funding obligations in
all market environments.
 
Legal entity structure. Our legal entity structure can constrain
liquidity available to Holdings. Some of our legal entities, particularly our
regulated broker-dealers and bank entities, are restricted in the amount of
funds that they can distribute or lend to Holdings. For a further discussion,
see Note 15, Regulatory Requirements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Certain regulated
subsidiaries are funded with subordinated debt issuances and/or subordinated
loans from Holdings, which are counted as regulatory capital for those
subsidiaries. Our policy is to fund subordinated debt advances by Holdings to
subsidiaries for use as regulatory capital with long-term debt issued by
Holdings having a maturity at least one year greater than the maturity of the
subordinated debt advance.
 
Credit Ratings
 
During the 2007 calendar year, Holdings and LBIs credit ratings were
upgraded by two of the rating agencies. Like other companies in the securities
industry, we rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our
day-to-day operations. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are
affected by our short-term and long-term credit ratings. Factors that may be
significant to the determination of our credit ratings or otherwise affect our
ability to raise short-term and long-term financing include our profit margin,
our earnings trend and volatility, our cash liquidity and liquidity management,
our capital structure, our risk level and risk management, our geographic and
business diversification, and our relative positions in the markets in which we
operate. Deterioration in any of these factors or combination of these factors
may lead rating agencies to downgrade our credit ratings. This may increase the
cost of, or possibly limit our access to, certain types of unsecured financings
and trigger additional collateral requirements in derivative contracts and other
secured funding arrangements. In addition, our debt ratings can affect certain
capital markets revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term
counterparty performance is critical, such as over-the-counter (OTC)
derivative transactions, including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps.

AA from AA (low).
 
At November 30, 2007,
counterparties had the right to require us to post additional collateral
pursuant to derivative contracts and other secured funding arrangements of approximately
$2.4 billion. Additionally, at that date we would have been required to post
additional collateral pursuant to such arrangements of approximately $0.1
billion in the event we were to experience a downgrade of our senior debt
rating of one notch and a further $4.6 billion in the event we were to
experience a downgrade of our senior debt rating of two notches.
 
Cash Flows
 
Cash and cash equivalents of $7.3
billion at November 30, 2007 increased by $1.3 billion from $6.0 billion
at November 30, 2006, as net cash provided by financing activities of
$48.6 billion was offset by net cash used in operating activities of $45.6
billion and net cash used in investing activities of $1.7 billion.
 
Balance Sheet
 
Assets. The assets on our balance sheet consist
primarily of Cash and cash equivalents, Financial instruments and other
inventory positions owned, and collateralized agreements. At November 30,
2007, our total assets increased by 37% to $691.1 billion from $503.5 billion
at November 30, 2006, due to an increase in secured financing transactions
and net assets. Net assets at November 30, 2007 increased $104.0 billion
from the prior year due to increases across most inventory categories, as well
as an increase in customer secured receivables, as we continued to grow the
Firm. Our calculation of Net assets excludes from total assets: (i) cash
and securities segregated and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes; (ii) collateralized
lending agreements; and (iii) identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.
We believe net assets to be a more useful measure of our assets than total
assets because it excludes certain low-risk, non-inventory assets. Our
calculation of Net assets may not be comparable to other, similarly titled
calculations by other companies as a result of different calculation
methodologies.
 
At November 30, 2007 and 2006 our total and net assets were
comprised of the following items:

Included within Net assets are real estate held for

investments.
 
Real estate held for sale. We invest in real estate through direct
investments in equity and debt. We record real estate held for sale at the
lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The assessment of
fair value less cost to sell generally requires the use of management estimates
and generally is based on property appraisals provided by third parties and
also incorporates an analysis of the related property cash flow projections. We
had real estate investments of approximately $21.9 billion and $9.4 billion at November 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively. Because portions of these assets have been financed
on a non-recourse basis, our net investment position was limited to $12.8
billion and $5.9 billion at November 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
High yield instruments. We underwrite, syndicate, invest
in and make markets in high yield corporate debt securities and loans. We
define high yield instruments as securities of or loans to companies rated BB+
or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies, as well as
non-rated securities or loans that, in managements opinion, are non-investment
grade. High yield debt instruments generally involve greater risks than
investment grade instruments and loans due to the issuers creditworthiness and
the lower liquidity of the market for such instruments, generally. In addition,
these issuers generally have relatively higher levels of indebtedness resulting
in an increased sensitivity to adverse economic conditions. We seek to reduce
these risks through active hedging strategies and through the diversification
of our products and counterparties.
 
High yield instruments are carried
at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reflected in Principal
transactions in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Our high yield
instruments at November 30, 2007 and 2006 were as follows:

(1)                Credit risk hedges
represent financial instruments with offsetting risk to the same underlying
counterparty, but exclude other credit and market risk mitigants which are
highly correlated, such as index, basket and/or sector hedges.
 
The increase in high-yield positions from 2006 to 2007 is primarily from
funded lending commitments that have not been syndicated. At November 30,
2007 and 2006, the largest industry concentrations were 26% and 20%,
respectively, and were in the finance and insurance industry classifications.
The largest geographic concentrations at November 30, 2007 and 2006 were
66% and 53%, respectively, in the Americas. We mitigate our aggregate and
single-issuer net exposure through the use of derivatives, non-recourse
financing and other financial instruments.
 
Private equity and other principal investments. Our Private Equity
business operates in six major asset classes: Merchant Banking, Real Estate,
Venture Capital, Credit-Related Investments, Private Funds Investments and
Infrastructure. We have raised privately-placed funds in these asset classes,
for which we act as a general partner and in which we have general and in many
cases limited partner interests. In addition, we generally co-invest in the
investments made by the funds or may make other non-fund-related direct
investments. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, our private equity related
investments totaled $4.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. The real
estate industry represented the highest concentrations at 41% and 30% at November 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively, and the largest single investment was
approximately $275 million and $80 million, at those respective dates.
 
Our private equity investments are measured at fair
value based on our assessment of each underlying investment, incorporating
valuations that consider expected cash flows, earnings multiples and/or
comparisons to similar market transactions, among other factors. Valuation
adjustments, which usually involve the use of significant management estimates,
are an integral part of pricing these instruments, reflecting consideration of
credit quality, concentration risk, sale restrictions and other liquidity
factors. For additional information about our private equity and other
principal investment activities, including related commitments, see Note 9, Commitments,
Contingencies and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Equity Management
 
The management of equity
is a critical aspect of our capital management. Determining the appropriate
amount of equity capital base is dependent on a number of variables, including
the amount of equity needed given our estimation of risk in our business
activities, the capital required by laws or regulations, leverage thresholds
required by the consolidated supervised entity (CSE) rules and credit
rating agencies perspectives of capital sufficiency.
 
We continuously evaluate
deployment alternatives for our equity with the objective of maximizing
shareholder value. In periods where we determine our levels of equity to be
beyond those necessary to support our business activities, we may return
capital to shareholders through dividend payments or stock repurchases.
 
We maintain a common
stock repurchase program to manage our equity capital. In January 2007,
our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions,
of up to 100 million shares of Holdings common stock for the management of our
equity capital, including offsetting dilution due to employee stock awards.
This authorization superseded the stock repurchase program authorized in 2006.
Our stock repurchase program is effected through 
 
-62-





 
LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
open-market purchases, as
well as through employee transactions where employees tender shares of common
stock to pay for the exercise price of stock options and the required tax
withholding obligations upon option exercises and conversion of restricted
stock units (RSUs) to freely-tradable common stock.
 
Over the course of our
2007 fiscal year, we repurchased through open-market purchases or withheld from
employees for the purposes described above approximately 43.0 million shares of
our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $3.2 billion, or $73.85
per share. During 2007, we issued 15.4 million shares resulting from employee
stock option exercises and another 24.5 million shares were issued out of
treasury stock to an irrevocable grantor trust that holds shares for issuance
to employees in satisfaction of restricted stock units granted under the Firms
equity compensation plans (the RSU Trust).
 
In January 2008, our
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of
up to 100 million shares of Holdings common stock for the management of the
Firms equity capital, including consideration of dilution due to employee
stock awards. This resolution supersedes the stock repurchase program
authorized in 2007.
 
Capital Ratios
 
Leverage
Ratios. The
relationship of assets to equity is one measure of a companys capital
adequacy. Generally, this leverage ratio is computed by dividing assets by
stockholders equity. We believe that a more meaningful, comparative ratio for
companies in the securities industry is net leverage, which is the result of
net assets divided by tangible equity capital.
 
Our net leverage ratio is
calculated as net assets divided by tangible equity capital. We calculate net
assets by excluding from total assets: (i) cash and securities segregated
and on deposit for regulatory and other purposes; (ii) collateralized
lending agreements; and (iii) identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.
We believe net leverage based on net assets to be a more useful measure of
leverage, because it excludes certain low-risk, non-inventory assets and
utilizes tangible equity capital as a measure of our equity base. We calculate
tangible equity capital by including stockholders equity and junior
subordinated notes and excluding identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.
We believe tangible equity capital to be a more meaningful measure of our
equity base for purposes of calculating net leverage because it includes
instruments we consider to be equity-like due to their subordinated nature,
long-term maturity and interest deferral features and we do not view the amount
of equity used to support identifiable intangible assets and goodwill as
available to support our remaining net assets. These measures may not be
comparable to other, similarly titled calculations by other companies as a
result of different calculation methodologies.

to Retained earnings from adoption of SFAS 157 and SFAS 159 and a $210 million
decrease to Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) from the adoption of
SFAS 158. See Accounting and Regulatory Developments below for additional
information. Other, net for 2006 includes a $6 million net decrease to Retained
earnings from the initial adoption of under SFAS 155 and SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assetsan amendment of FASB
Statement No. 140 (SFAS 156).
Primary
Equity Double Leverage. Primary equity double leverage ratio is the comparison
of Holdings equity investments in subsidiaries to total equity capital (the
sum of total stockholders equity and junior subordinated notes). As of November 30,
2007, our equity investment in subsidiaries was $25.1 billion and our total equity
capital calculated was $27.5 billion. We aim to maintain a primary equity
double leverage ratio of 1.0x or below. Our primary equity double leverage
ratio was 0.91x and 0.88x as of November 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
We believe total equity capital to be a more meaningful measure of our equity
than stockholders equity because we consider junior subordinated notes to be
equity-like due to their subordinated nature, long-term maturity and interest
deferral features. We believe primary equity double leverage based on total
equity capital to be a useful measure of our equity investments in
subsidiaries. Our calculation of primary equity double leverage may not be
comparable to other, similarly titled calculations by other companies as a
result of different calculation methodologies.

(1)     We view our net credit exposure for high grade commitments,
after consideration of hedges, to be $12.2 billion and $4.9 billion at November 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively.
(2)     We
view our net credit exposure for high yield commitments, after consideration of
hedges, to be $12.8 billion and $5.9 billion at November 30, 2007 and
2006, respectively.
We use various hedging and funding
strategies to actively manage our market, credit and liquidity exposures on
these commitments. We do not believe total commitments necessarily are
indicative of actual risk or funding requirements because the commitments may
not be drawn or fully used and such amounts are reported before consideration
of hedges.
 
Lending commitments. Through our high grade (investment
grade) and high yield (non-investment grade) sales, trading and underwriting
activities, we make commitments to extend credit in loan syndication
transactions. These commitments and any related drawdowns of these facilities
typically have fixed maturity dates and are contingent on certain
representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the
borrower. We define high yield exposures as securities of or loans to companies
rated BB+ or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies,
as well as non-rated securities or loans that, in managements opinion, are
non-investment grade.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations
 
We had commitments to high grade borrowers at November 30, 2007 and
2006 of $24.0 billion (net credit exposure of $12.2 billion, after
consideration of hedges) and $17.9 billion (net credit exposure of $4.9
billion, after consideration of hedges), respectively. We had commitments to
high yield borrowers of $14.1 billion (net credit exposure of $12.8 billion,
after consideration of hedges) and $7.6 billion (net credit exposure of $5.9
billion, after consideration of hedges) at November 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.
 
Contingent acquisition facilities. We provide contingent commitments
to investment and non-investment grade counterparties related to acquisition
financing. We do not believe contingent acquisition commitments are necessarily
indicative of actual risk or funding requirements as funding is dependent both
upon a proposed transaction being completed and the acquiror fully utilizing
our commitment. Typically, these commitments are made to a potential acquiror
in a proposed acquisition, which may or may not be completed depending on
whether the potential acquiror to whom we have provided our commitment is
successful. A contingent borrowers ability to draw on the commitment is
typically subject to there being no material adverse change in the borrowers
financial condition, among other factors, and the commitments also generally
contain certain flexible pricing features to adjust for changing market
conditions prior to closing. In addition, acquirers generally utilize multiple
financing sources, including other investment and commercial banks, as well as
accessing the general capital markets for completing transactions. Therefore,
our contingent acquisition commitments are generally greater than the amounts
we expect we will ultimately fund. Further, our past practice, consistent with
our credit facilitation framework, has been to syndicate acquisition financings
to investors. The ultimate timing, amount and pricing of a syndication,
however, is influenced by market conditions that may not necessarily be
consistent with those at the time the commitment was entered. We provided contingent commitments to high grade
counterparties related to acquisition financing of approximately $10.2 billion
and $1.9 billion at November 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and to high
yield counterparties related to acquisition financing of approximately $9.8
billion and $12.8 billion at November 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
Mortgage commitments. Through our mortgage origination
platforms we make commitments to extend mortgage loans. At November 30,
2007 and 2006, we had outstanding mortgage commitments of approximately $7.4
billion and $12.2 billion, respectively. These commitments included $3.0
billion and $7.0 billion of residential mortgages in 2007 and 2006 and $4.4
billion and $5.2 billion of commercial mortgages at 2007 and 2006. Typically,
residential mortgage loan commitments require us to originate mortgage loans at
the option of a borrower generally within 90 days at fixed interest rates.
Consistent with past practice, our intention is to sell residential mortgage
loans, once originated, primarily through securitizations. The ability to sell
or securitize mortgage loans, however, is dependent on market conditions.
 
Secured lending transactions. In connection with our financing
activities, we had outstanding commitments under certain collateralized lending
arrangements of approximately $9.8 billion and $7.5 billion at November 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively. These commitments require borrowers to provide acceptable
collateral, as defined in the agreements, when amounts are drawn under the
lending facilities. Advances made under these lending arrangements typically
are at variable interest rates and generally provide for
over-collateralization. In addition, at November 30, 2007, we had
commitments to enter into forward starting secured resale and repurchase
agreements, primarily secured by government and government agency collateral,
of $70.8 billion and $45.3 billion, respectively, compared to $44.4 billion and
$31.2 billion, respectively, at November 30, 2006.
 
For additional information about lending-related commitments, see Note 9, Commitments,
Contingencies and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

 
In the normal course of business we engage in a variety of
off-balance-sheet arrangements, including certain derivative contracts meeting
the FIN No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45), definition of a guarantee that
may require future payments. Other than lending-related commitments already
discussed above in Lending-Related Commitments, the following table
summarizes our off-balance-sheet arrangements at November 30, 2007 and
2006 as follows:

(1)     We
believe the fair value of these derivative contracts is a more relevant measure
of the obligations because we believe the notional amount overstates the
expected payout. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, the fair value of these
derivative contracts approximated $36.8 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively.
In accordance with FIN 45, the table above includes only certain
derivative contracts meeting the FIN 45 definition of a guarantee. For
additional information on these guarantees and other off-balance-sheet
arrangements, see Note 9 Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees, to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Derivatives
 
Neither derivatives notional
amounts nor underlying instrument values are reflected as assets or liabilities
in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. Rather, the market, or
fair values, related to derivative transactions are reported in the
Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as assets or liabilities in
Derivatives and other contractual agreements, as applicable. Derivatives are
presented on a net-by-counterparty basis when a legal right of offset exists,
on a net-by-cross product basis when applicable provisions are stated in a
master netting agreement; and/or on a net of cash collateral received or paid
on a counterparty basis, provided a legal right of offset exists.
 
We enter into derivative transactions both in a trading capacity and as an
end-user. Acting in a trading capacity, we enter into derivative transactions
to satisfy the needs of our clients and to manage our own exposure to market
and credit risks resulting from our trading activities (collectively, Trading-Related
Derivatives).
 
As an end-user, we primarily use derivatives to hedge our exposure to
market risk (including foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks) and
credit risks (collectively, End-User Derivatives). When End-User Derivatives
are interest rate swaps they are measured at fair value through earnings and
the carrying value of the related hedged item is adjusted through earnings for
the effect of changes in the fair value of the risk being hedged. The hedge
ineffectiveness in these relationships is recorded in Interest expense in the
Consolidated Statement of Income. When End-User Derivatives are used in hedges
of net investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries, the
gains or losses are reported within Accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss), net of tax, in Stockholders equity.
 
We conduct our derivative activities through a number of wholly-owned
subsidiaries. Our fixed income derivative products business is principally
conducted through our subsidiary Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc., and
separately capitalized AAA rated subsidiaries, Lehman Brothers Financial
Products Inc. and Lehman Brothers Derivative Products Inc. Our equity
derivative products business is conducted through Lehman Brothers Finance S.A.
and Lehman Brothers OTC Derivatives Inc. Our commodity and energy derivatives
product business is conducted through Lehman Brothers Commodity Services Inc.
In addition, as a global investment bank, we also are a market maker in a
number of foreign currencies. Counterparties to our derivative product transactions
primarily are U.S. and foreign banks, securities firms, corporations,
governments and their agencies, finance companies, insurance companies,
investment companies and pension funds. We manage the risks associated with
derivatives on an aggregate basis, along with the risks associated with our
non-derivative trading and market-making activities in cash instruments, as
part of our firm wide risk management policies. We use industry standard
derivative contracts whenever appropriate.
 
For additional information about our accounting policies and our
Trading-Related Derivative activities, see Note 1, Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Financial Instruments and Other Inventory
Positions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Special Purpose Entities
 
We
enter into various transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs). SPEs
may be corporations, trusts or partnerships that are established for a limited
purpose. There are two types of SPEs QSPEs and VIEs.
 
-67-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations
 
A QSPE
generally can be described as an entity whose permitted activities are limited
to passively holding financial assets and distributing cash flows to investors
based on pre-set terms. Our primary involvement with QSPEs relates to
securitization transactions in which transferred assets, including mortgages,
loans, receivables and other financial assets, are sold to an SPE that
qualifies as a QSPE under SFAS 140. In accordance with SFAS 140 and FIN-46(R),
we do not consolidate QSPEs. We recognize at fair value the interests we hold
in the QSPEs. We derecognize financial assets transferred to QSPEs, provided we
have surrendered control over the assets.
 
Certain SPEs do not meet the QSPE criteria because their permitted
activities are not limited sufficiently or the assets are non-qualifying
financial instruments (e.g., real
estate). These SPEs are referred to as VIEs, and we typically use them to
create securities with a unique risk profile desired by investors to
intermediate financial risk or to invest in real estate. Examples of our
involvement with VIEs include collateralized debt obligations, synthetic credit
transactions, real estate investments through VIEs, and other structured
financing transactions. Under FIN 46(R), we consolidate a VIE if we are the
primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary is the party that
either (i) absorbs a majority of the VIEs expected losses; (ii) receives
a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns; or (iii) both.
 
For a further discussion
of our consolidation policies, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Consolidation Accounting Policies in this MD&A. For a further discussion
of our securitization activities and our involvement with VIEs, see Note 6, Securitizations
and Special Purpose Entities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Other Off-Balance-Sheet Exposure
 
SIVs. A structured investment vehicle (SIV)
is an entity that borrows money in the form of commercial paper, medium-term
notes or subordinated capital notes, and uses the proceeds to purchase assets,
including asset-backed or mortgage-backed securities. We do not own, manage or
sponsor any SIVs. Our SIV-related exposure is limited to that acquired through
proprietary investments or trading activity, specifically:
 
·                  At November 30,
2007, we had approximately $75 million of balance sheet exposure representing
the aggregate of a fully drawn liquidity loan to a SIV, and medium-term notes
and commercial paper issued by SIVs bought in the primary or secondary markets.
 
·                  We have entered into
derivative transactions to which SIVs are counterparties. The total notional
amount of these derivative transactions was approximately $4.1 billion at November 30,
2007. We believe the fair value of these derivative transactions is a more
relevant measure of the obligations because we believe the notional amount
overstates the expected payout. At November 30, 2007, the fair value of
these derivative contracts approximated $50 million. For a further discussion
of derivative transactions, see Note 9, Commitments, Contingencies and
Guarantees Other Commitments and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
·                  Under resell or
repurchase agreements, we have balance sheet exposure to commercial paper
issued by SIVs. This exposure was approximately $14 million at November 30,
2007. For a further discussion of resell and repurchase agreements, see Note 5,
Securities Received and Pledged as Collateral, to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
·                  We manage certain private equity and other alternative
investment funds which are not consolidated into our results of operations. At November 30,
2007, a small percentage of the assets within those funds have SIV-related
exposure.
 
Conduits. Conduits are entities established to convey
financing. They are thinly capitalized SPE structures established on behalf of
a sponsor or sponsors that purchase assets from multiple parties, funding those
purchases by issuing commercial paper. Assets held in a conduit serve as
collateral for the commercial paper issued by the conduit. We are a sponsor,
guarantor, and/or liquidity and credit facility provider to certain conduits.
Specifically:
 
·                  We make certain liquidity commitments and guarantees
to commercial paper conduits in support of certain clients secured financing
transactions. These commitments and guarantees obligate us to provide liquidity
to these conduits in the event the conduits cannot obtain funding in the
market; however, our obligation is limited to the total amount required to fund
our clients assets in the conduit. At November 30, 2007, the amount of
these commitments was approximately $1.4 billion. We believe our actual risk to
be limited because these liquidity commitments are supported by high quality
collateral. For a further discussion of derivative transactions, see Note 9, Commitments,
Contingencies and Guarantees Other Commitments and Guarantees, to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
·                  We provide guarantees to investors in certain VIEs.
These guarantees may include a guaranteed return of the investors initial
investment or of the investors initial investment plus an agreed upon return
depending on the terms. At November 30, 2007, these commitments were
approximately $6.1 billion. We believe our actual risk to be limited because
our obligations are collateralized by the VIEs assets and contain significant
constraints

under which
downside protection will be available (e.g., the VIE
is required to liquidate assets in the event certain loss levels are
triggered). For a further discussion, see Note 9, Commitments, Contingencies
and Guarantees Other Commitments and Guarantees, to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
·                  We have established a $2.4 billion conduit that issues
secured liquidity notes to pre-fund high grade loan commitments. This conduit
is consolidated in Holdings results of operations. This is fully backed by a
triple-A rated, third-party, one-year revolving liquidity back stop, which we
have in turn fully backed. This conduit is consolidated in Holdings results of
operations.
 
·                  We participate in an A-1/P-1-rated multi-seller
conduit. This multi-seller issues secured liquidity notes to provide financing.
Our intention is to utilize this conduit for purposes of funding a portion of
our contingent acquisition commitments. At November 30, 2007, we were
contingently committed to provide $1.6 billion of liquidity if the conduit is
unable to remarket the secured liquidity notes upon their maturity, generally,
one year after a failed remarketing event. This conduit is not consolidated in
Holdings results of operations. For a further discussion of derivative
transactions, see Note 9, Commitments, Contingencies and GuaranteesOther
Commitments and Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
·                  As a dealer and agent in the commercial paper market,
we hold a minimal amount in inventory from various conduit programs, including
the multi-seller conduit discussed above. At November 30, 2007, the amount
of commercial paper in our inventory from conduit programs in which we
participate, as dealer and/or agent, was approximately $850 million.
 

Risk Management

 
Our goal is to realize
returns from our business commensurate with the risks assumed. Our business
activities have inherent risks that we monitor, evaluate and manage through a
comprehensive risk management structure. These risks include market, credit,
liquidity, operational and reputational exposures, among others.
 
The bases of our risk
control processes are:
 
·                  We establish policies to document our risk principles, our risk
capacity and tolerance levels.
 
·                  We monitor and enforce adherence to our risk policies.
 
·                  We measure quantifiable risks using methodologies and models based on
tested assumptions.
 
·                  We identify emerging risks through monitoring our portfolios, new
business development, unusual or complex transactions and external events and
market influences.
 
·                  We report risks to stakeholders.
 
Risk Management Structure
 
While risk cannot be
completely eliminated, we have designed our internal control environment to put
appropriate risk mitigants in place. Our control processes separate the duties
of risk management from revenue generation and effect management oversight of
the risk management function.
 
Our overall risk limits and risk management policies, including
establishment of risk tolerance levels, are determined by the Risk
Committee.  The Risk Committee, which
includes managements Executive Committee, the Global Head of Risk Management
and certain other members of senior management, reviews our risk exposures,
position concentrations and risk-taking activities on a weekly basis, or more
frequently as needed.  Our Risk Committee
allocates the usage of capital to each of our businesses and establishes
trading and credit limits for counterparties with a goal to maintain
diversification of our businesses, counterparties and geographic presence.
 
The Global Risk Management Division (the Division) is independent of
revenue-generation but maintains a presence in our regional trading centers as
well as in key sales offices. The Divisions role is to assist in explaining
our risks and making them clear to management and others. The organization of
the Division reflects our integrated approach to risk management, bringing
together the skill sets of credit, market, quantitative, sovereign and
operational risk management groups.

Market Risk
 
Market risk is the
potential change to the market value of our trading and investing positions. We
assume market risk in our market-making, specialist, proprietary trading,
investing and underwriting activities.
 
Market risk can result
from changes in market variables, including:
 
·                  Changes in the level, slope or shape of yield curves (interest rates),
widening or tightening of general spread levels (credit or credit-related
spreads) and volatility of interest rates.
 
·                  Directional movements in prices and volatilities of individual equities,
equity baskets and equity indices.
 
·                  Movement of domestic and foreign currency rates.
 
·                  Price movements of commodities such as electricity, natural gas, and
oil.
 
·                  Changes in asset valuations.
 
Responsibility for
defining and monitoring market risk tolerance levels is that of our Market Risk
Management Department (the MRM Department). Based upon the MRM Departments
established thresholds, management applies business judgment to mitigate these
risks, managing our risk exposures by diversifying portfolios, limiting
position sizes and establishing economic hedges. Both the MRM Department and
management also rely upon the Quantitative Risk Management Department (the QRM
Department) to ensure that both quantifiable and unquantifiable risk is identified,
assessed and managed.
 
Management and the MRM
and QRM Departments use qualitative and quantitative risk measures and analyses
such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates, prices, and implied volatilities.
Stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios
of specific changes in market factors for certain products, is performed with
regularity. Scenario analyses, which estimate sensitivity to a set of
predefined market and/or external events, are also conducted periodically. A
statistical measure of the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due
to adverse movements in underlying risk factors known as value-at-risk (VaR)
is also used to monitor and manage market risk.
 
VaR. We estimate VaR using a model that
simulates the impact market risk factors would have on our portfolio. Our
calculation of VaR is an approximation of earning and loss distributions our
portfolio would realize if current market risks were observed in historical
markets. Our method uses four years of historical data, weighted to give
greater impact to more recent time periods in simulating potential changes in
market risk factors, and estimates the amount that our current portfolio could
lose with a specified degree of confidence, over a given time interval.
 
For the table below, a
one-day time interval and a 95% confidence level were used. This means that
there is a 1-in-20 chance that daily trading net revenue losses on a particular
day would exceed the reported VaR.
 
In a historical simulation
VaR, portfolio positions have offsetting risk characteristics, referred to as
diversification benefit. We measure the diversification benefit within our
portfolio by historically simulating how the positions in our current portfolio
would have behaved in relation to each other as opposed to using a static
estimate of a diversification benefit, which remains relatively constant from
period to period. From time to time there will be changes in our historical
simulation VaR due to changes in the diversification benefit across our
portfolio of financial instruments.
 
VaR measures have inherent limitations including: historical market
conditions and historical changes in market risk factors may not be accurate
predictors of future market conditions or future market risk factors; VaR
measurements are based on current positions, while future risk depends on
future positions; and VaR based on a one-day measurement period does not fully
capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within
one day. VaR is not intended to capture worst case scenario losses and we could
incur losses greater than the VaR amounts reported.
 
There is no uniform industry methodology for estimating VaR. Different
assumptions concerning the number of risk factors, the duration of the time
series and daily changes in these risk factors, as well as different
methodologies could produce materially different results and therefore caution
should be used when comparing VaR measures among comparable institutions.

The increase in both the
period end and quarterly average historical simulation VaR was primarily due to
increased market volatilities which increased the overall risk across multiple
business segments. Coincident with the increased market volatilities across
many asset classes was a reduction in diversification between the individual
components of market risk.
 
As part of our risk
management control processes, we monitor daily trading net revenues compared with
reported historical simulation VaR as of the end of the prior business day. In
the 2007 fiscal year, there were four days or 1.6% of days in the period, all occurring
in the second half of the twelve month period, when our daily net trading loss
exceeded our historical simulation VaR as measured at the close of the previous
business day. This compares with an expectation that actual losses would exceed
daily net trading losses on 5% of occasions using a 95% confidence level.
 
Real estate investments
are not financial instruments and therefore not contemplated within the VaR
calculation. We use stress testing to evaluate risks associated with our real
estate portfolios. As of November 30, 2007, we had approximately $21.9
billion of real estate investments; however, our net investment at risk was
limited to $12.8 billion as a portion of these assets have been financed on a
non-recourse basis. As of November 30, 2007, we estimate that a
hypothetical 10% decline in the underlying property values associated with the
non-syndicated investments would have resulted in a net revenue loss of
approximately $980 million.
 
Credit Risk
 
Credit risk represents
the loss incurred as a result of failure by a client, counterparty or issuer to
meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk is inherent in traditional
banking products  loans, commitments to lend and contingent liabilities  and
in traded products  derivative contracts such as forwards, swaps and
options, repurchase agreements (repos and reverse repos), debt securities and
securities borrowing and lending transactions.
 
Management and in
particular our Credit Risk Management Department (the CRM Department) define
and monitor credit risk and exposure. The CRM Department approves
counterparties, assigns internal risk ratings, and establishes credit limits,
among other risk mitigation procedures. The CRM Department monitors and reviews
counterparty risk ratings, current credit exposures and potential credit
exposures across products and recommends valuation adjustments, when
appropriate. Given market events or counterparties changes in financial
conditions, additional review and adjustment procedures may be undertaken. We
also seek to reduce our current and potential credit exposures by
 
-71-

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations
 
entering into agreements
that: offset receivables from and payables to a counterparty; obtain upfront or
contingent collateral from counterparties; provide a third-party guarantee for
a counterpartys obligations; and transfer our credit risk to third parties
using structures or techniques such as credit derivatives. Working with the MRM
Department, the CRM Department also participates in transaction approval, where
the risks of the transaction on a stand-alone basis as well as our aggregate
risk exposure to the obligor are considered.
 
Credit
Risk on Derivatives. Derivatives
are exchange traded or privately negotiated contracts that derive their value
from an underlying asset. Derivatives are useful for risk management because
the fair values or cash flows of derivatives can be used to offset the changes
in fair values or cash flows of other financial instruments. In addition to
risk management, we enter into derivative transactions for purposes of client
transactions or establishing trading positions. The presentation of derivatives
in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position is net of payments and
receipts and, in instances where management determines a legal right of offset
exists as a result of a netting agreement, net-by-counterparty. Risk for an OTC
derivative includes credit risk associated with the counterparty in the
negotiated contract and continues for the duration of that contract.
 
The fair value of our OTC derivative assets at November 30, 2007 and
2006, was $41.3 billion and $19.5 billion, respectively; however, we view our
net credit exposure to have been $34.6 billion and $15.6 billion at November 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively, representing the fair value of OTC derivative
contracts in a net receivable position after consideration of collateral.
 
The following tables set forth the fair value of OTC derivative assets and
liabilities by contract type and related net credit exposure, as of November 30,
2007 and November 30, 2006, respectively.

Revenue Volatility
 
The overall effectiveness
of our risk management practices can be evaluated on a broader perspective when
analyzing the distribution of daily net trading revenues over time. We consider
net trading revenue volatility over time to be a comprehensive evaluator of our
overall risk management practices because it incorporates the results of
virtually all of our trading activities and types of risk.
 
The following table shows
a measure of daily trading net revenue volatility, utilizing actual daily
trading net revenues over the previous rolling 250 trading days at a 95%
confidence level. This measure represents the loss relative to the median
actual daily trading net revenues over the previous rolling 250 trading days,
measured at a 95% confidence level.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations
 
This means there is a
1-in-20 chance that actual daily trading net revenues would be expected to
decline by an amount in excess of the reported revenue volatility measure.

Average trading net revenue
volatility measured in this manner was $48 million for the year ended November 30,
2007, a 37% increase from the comparable measure for the year ended November 30,
2006. The increase of this measurement in fiscal year 2007 was primarily driven
by increased volatilities in overall markets.
 
The following chart sets forth the
frequency distribution for daily trading net revenues for our Capital Markets
and Investment Management business segments (including trading activity in the
fixed income and equity markets undertaken on behalf of client investors and
excluding any trading activity undertaken on behalf of those investors in
private equity offerings) for the years ended November 30, 2007 and 2006:

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations
 

 
For the year ended November 30,
2007, the largest loss in daily trading net revenues on any single day was $137
million. For the year ended November 30, 2006, the largest loss in daily
trading net revenues on any single day was $59 million.
 
Liquidity Risk
 
Liquidity risk is the
potential that we are unable to:
 
·                  Meet our payment obligations when due;
 
·                  Borrow funds in the market on an on-going basis and at an acceptable
price to fund actual or proposed commitments; or
 
·                  Liquidate assets in a timely manner at a reasonable price.
 
Managements Finance
Committee is responsible for developing, implementing and enforcing our
liquidity, funding and capital policies. These policies include recommendations
for capital and balance sheet size as well as the allocation of capital to the
business units. Managements Finance Committee oversees compliance with
policies and limits with the goal of ensuring we are not exposed to undue
liquidity, funding or capital risk.
 
Our liquidity strategy
seeks to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet all of our
funding obligations in all market environments. That strategy is centered on
five principles:
 
·                  Maintaining a liquidity pool that is of sufficient size to cover
expected cash outflows for one year in a stressed liquidity environment.
 
·                  Relying on secured funding only to the extent that we believe it would
be available in all market environments.
 
·                  Diversifying our funding sources to minimize reliance on any given
provider.
 
·                  Assessing our liquidity at the legal entity level. For example, because
our legal entity structure can constrain liquidity available to Holdings, our
liquidity pool excludes liquidity that is restricted from availability to
Holdings.
 
·                  Maintaining a comprehensive funding action plan to manage a stress
liquidity event, including a communication plan for regulators, creditors,
investors and clients.
 
For further discussion of
our liquidity positions, see Liquidity, Funding and Capital Resources in this
MD&A.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations
 
Operational Risk
 
Operational risk is the
risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and
systems, or from external causes, whether deliberate, accidental or natural.
Operational risk may arise from mistakes, intentional or otherwise, in the
execution, confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not
being properly recorded, evaluated or accounted. Our businesses are highly dependent
on our ability to daily process a large number of transactions across numerous
and diverse markets in many currencies, and these transactions have become
increasingly complex. Consequently, we rely heavily on our financial,
accounting and other data processing systems. In recent years, we have
substantially upgraded and expanded the capabilities of our data processing
systems and other operating technology, and we expect that we will need to
continue to upgrade and expand in the future to avoid disruption of, or
constraints on, our operations.
 
The Operational Risk
Management Department is responsible for implementing and maintaining our
overall global operational risk management framework, which seeks to minimize
these risks through assessing, reporting, monitoring and mitigating operational
risks.
 
We have a company-wide
business continuity plan (the BCP). The BCP objective is to ensure that we
can continue critical operations with limited processing interruption in the
event of a business disruption. The business continuity group manages our
internal incident response process and develops and maintains continuity plans
for critical business functions and infrastructure. This includes determining
how vital business activities will be performed until normal processing
capabilities can be restored. The business continuity group is also responsible
for facilitating disaster recovery and business continuity training and
preparedness for our employees.
 
Reputational and Other Risk
 
We recognize that maintaining
our reputation among clients, investors, regulators and the general public is
critical. Maintaining our reputation depends on a large number of factors,
including the selection of our clients and the conduct of our business
activities. We seek to maintain our reputation by screening potential clients
and by conducting our business activities in accordance with high ethical
standards.
 
Potential clients are
screened through a multi-step process that begins with the individual business
units and product groups. In screening clients, these groups undertake a
comprehensive review of the client and its background and the potential
transaction to determine, among other things, whether they pose any risks to
our reputation. Potential transactions are screened by independent committees
in the Firm, which are composed of senior members from various corporate
divisions of the Company including members of the Division. These committees
review the nature of the client and its business, the due diligence conducted
by the business units and product groups and the proposed terms of the
transaction to determine overall acceptability of the proposed transaction. In
so doing, the committees evaluate the appropriateness of the transaction,
including a consideration of ethical and social responsibility issues and the
potential effect of the transaction on our reputation.
 
We are exposed to other
risks having an ability to adversely impact our business. Such risks include
legal, geopolitical, tax and regulatory risks that may come to bear due to
changes in local laws, regulations, accounting standards or tax statutes. To
assist in the mitigation of such risks, we monitor and review regulatory,
statutory or legal proposals that could impact our businesses. See Certain
Factors Affecting Results of Operations above and Risk Factors in Part I,
Item 1A in this Form 10-K.
 

2-for-1 Stock Split

 
On April 5, 2006, the
stockholders of Holdings approved an increase in the Companys authorized
shares of common stock to 1.2 billion from 600 million, and the Board of
Directors approved a 2-for-1 common stock split, in the form of a stock
dividend, for holders of record as of April 18, 2006, which was paid on April 28,
2006. On April 5, 2006, the Companys Restated Certificate of Incorporation
was amended to effect the increase in authorized common shares.
 

Accounting and Regulatory Developments

 
The following summarizes
accounting standards that have been issued during the periods covered by the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the effect of adoption on our results of
operations, if any, actual or estimated.
 
SFAS 123(R). In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS 123(R), which establishes standards of accounting for
transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and
services and focuses primarily on accounting
 
-76-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations
 
for transaction in which an entity obtains employee services in
share-based payment transactions. Two key differences between SFAS No. 123,
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,
and SFAS 123(R) relate to the attribution of compensation costs to
reporting periods and accounting for award forfeitures. SFAS 123(R) generally
requires the immediate expensing of equity-based awards granted to
retirement-eligible employees or awards granted subject to substantive
non-compete agreements be expensed over the non-compete period. SFAS 123(R) also
requires expected forfeitures to be included in determining stock-based
employee compensation expense. We adopted SFAS 123(R) as of the beginning
of our 2006 fiscal year and recognized an after-tax gain of approximately $47
million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
attributable to the requirement to estimate forfeitures at the date of grant
instead of recognizing them as incurred. For additional information, see Note
12, Share-Based Employee Incentive Plans, to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
SFAS 155. In
February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 155, which permits an entity to
measure at fair value any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded
derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation. As permitted, we early
adopted SFAS 155 in the first quarter of 2006. The effect of adoption resulted
in a $24 million after-tax ($43 million pre-tax) decrease to opening retained
earnings as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, representing the
difference between the fair value of these hybrid financial instruments and the prior carrying value as of November 30,
2005.
 
SFAS 156. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS
156, which permits entities to elect to measure servicing assets and servicing
liabilities at fair value and report changes in fair value in earnings. As a
result of adopting SFAS 156, we recognized an $18 million after-tax ($33
million pre-tax) increase to opening retained earnings in our 2006 fiscal year.
 
SFAS
157. In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value, outlines a fair value hierarchy based on inputs used
to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 does not change existing guidance as to whether or not
an instrument is carried at fair value.
 
SFAS 157 also (i) nullifies
the guidance in EITF No. 02-3, Accounting for Derivative
Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading
and Risk Management Activities (EITF 02-3) that precluded the
recognition of a trading profit at the inception of a derivative contract,
unless the fair value of such derivative was obtained from a quoted market
price or other valuation technique incorporating observable inputs; (ii) clarifies
that an issuers credit standing should be considered when measuring
liabilities at fair value; (iii) precludes the use of a liquidity or block
discount when measuring instruments traded in an active market at fair value;
and (iv) requires costs related to acquiring financial instruments carried
at fair value to be included in earnings as incurred.
 
We elected to early adopt SFAS 157 at the beginning of
2007 fiscal year and we recorded the difference between the carrying amounts
and fair values of (i) stand-alone derivatives and/or certain hybrid
financial instruments measured using the guidance in EITF 02-3 on recognition
of a trading profit at the inception of a derivative, and (ii) financial
instruments that are traded in active markets that were measured at fair value
using block discounts, as a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained
earnings. As a result of adopting SFAS 157, we recognized a $45 million
after-tax ($78 million pre-tax) increase to opening retained earnings. For
additional information regarding our adoption of SFAS 157, see Note 4, Fair
Value of Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
SFAS
158. In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Retirement Plans (SFAS 158),
which requires an employer to recognize the over- or under-funded status of its
defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Statement of Financial
Condition, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets
and the benefit obligation. For pension plans the benefit obligation is the
projected benefit obligation while for other postretirement plans the benefit
obligation is the accumulated postretirement obligation. Upon adoption, SFAS
158 requires an employer to recognize previously unrecognized actuarial gains
and losses and prior service costs within Accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss) (net of tax), a component of Stockholders equity. In accordance
with the guidance in SFAS No.158, we adopted this provision of the standard for
the year ended November 30, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No.158 reduced
Accumulated other comprehensive income/ (loss), by $210 million after-tax ($344
million pre-tax) at November 30, 2007.
 
SFAS
159. In February 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS 159 which permits certain financial assets and financial
liabilities to be measured at fair value, using an instrument-by-instrument
election. The initial effect of adopting SFAS 159 must be accounted for as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings for the fiscal year
in which we apply SFAS 159. Retrospective application of SFAS 159 to fiscal
years preceding the effective date is not permitted.
 
We elected to early adopt SFAS 159 beginning in our
2007 fiscal year and to measure at fair value substantially all hybrid
financial instruments not previously accounted for at fair value under SFAS No. 155,
as well as certain deposit liabilities

at our U.S. banking subsidiaries. We elected to adopt
SFAS 159 for these instruments to reduce the complexity of accounting for these
instruments under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities. As a result of adopting SFAS
159, we recognized a $22 million after-tax increase ($35 million pre-tax) to
opening retained earnings as of December 1, 2006, representing the effect
of changing the measurement basis of these financial instruments from an
adjusted amortized cost basis at November 30, 2006 to fair value.
 
SFAS 141(R). In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations
(SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) expands the definition of transactions and
events that qualify as business combinations; requires that the acquired assets
and liabilities, including contingencies, be recorded at the fair value
determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in revenue,
not goodwill; changes the recognition timing for restructuring costs; and
requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred. Adoption of SFAS 141(R) is
required for combinations after December 15, 2008. Early adoption and
retroactive application of SFAS 141(R) to fiscal years preceding the
effective date are not permitted. We are evaluating the impact of adoption on
our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
SFAS
160. In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in
Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 160
re-characterizes minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries as
non-controlling interests and requires the classification of minority interests
as a component of equity. Under SFAS 160, a change in control will be measured
at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. The effective date
for SFAS 160 is for annual periods beginning on or after December 15,
2008. Early adoption and retroactive application of SFAS 160 to fiscal years
preceding the effective date are not permitted. We are evaluating the impact of
adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN
48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes
(FIN 48), which sets out a framework for management to use to determine the
appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. This
interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
Taxes, uses a two-step approach wherein a tax benefit is recognized
if a position is more likely than not to be sustained, and the amount of
benefit is then measured on a probabilistic approach, as defined in FIN 48. FIN
48 also sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of an entitys
tax reserves. We must adopt FIN 48 as of the beginning of our 2008 fiscal year.
We estimate that the effect of adopting FIN 48 at the beginning of the first
quarter of 2008 to be a decrease to opening retained earnings of approximately
$190 million.
 
SOP
07-1. In June 2007,
the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) No. 07-1, Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide Investment
Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for
Investments in Investment Companies (SOP 07-1). SOP 07-1 addresses
when the accounting principles of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide
Investment Companies must be applied by an entity and whether those accounting
principles must be retained by a parent company in consolidation or by an
investor in the application of the equity method of accounting. SOP 07-1 is
effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2008. We are
evaluating the effect of adopting SOP 07-1 on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
EITF Issue No. 04-5. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the
consensus reached in EITF 04-5 which requires general partners (or managing
members in the case of limited liability companies) to consolidate their
partnerships or to provide limited partners with either (i) rights to
remove the general partner without cause or to liquidate the partnership; or (ii) substantive
participation rights. As the general partner of numerous private equity and
asset management partnerships, we adopted EITF 04-5 effective June 30,
2005 for partnerships formed or modified after June 29, 2005. For
partnerships formed on or before June 29, 2005 that had not been modified,
we adopted EITF 04-5 as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year. The adoption
of EITF 04-5 did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
FSP
FIN 46(R)-6. In
April 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FIN 46(R)-6, Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB
Interpretation No. 46(R) (FSP FIN 46(R)-6). This FSP
addresses how a reporting enterprise should determine the variability to be
considered in applying FIN 46(R) by requiring an analysis of the purpose
for which an entity was created and the variability that the entity was
designed to create. We adopted FSP FIN 46(R)-6 on September 1, 2006 and
applied it prospectively to all entities in which we first became involved
after that date. Adoption of FSP FIN 46(R)-6 did not have a material effect on
our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
FSP
FIN 39-1. In April 2007,
the FASB directed the FASB Staff to issue FSP No. FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39 (FSP FIN 39-1).
FSP FIN 39-1 modifies FIN No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts
Related to Certain Contracts, and permits companies to offset cash
collateral receivables or payables with net derivative positions under certain
circumstances. FSP FIN 39-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007, with early adoption permitted. FSP FIN 39-1 does not affect our
Consolidated Financial Statements because it clarified the acceptability of
existing market practice, which we use, of netting cash collateral against net
derivative assets and liabilities.

FSP
FIN 48-1. In May 2007,
the FASB directed the FASB Staff to issue FSP No. FIN 48-1, Definition of Settlement In FASB Interpretation No. 48
(FSP FIN 48-1). Under FSP FIN 48-1, a previously unrecognized tax benefit may
be subsequently recognized if the tax position is effectively settled and other
specified criteria are met. We are evaluating the effect of adopting FSP FIN
48-1 on our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our evaluation of the
effect of adopting FIN 48.
 
FSP
FIN 46(R)-7.
In May 2007, the FASB directed the FASB Staff to issue FSP No. FIN
46(R)-7, Application of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) to
Investment Companies (FSP FIN 46(R)-7). FSP FIN 46(R)-7 makes
permanent the temporary deferral of the application of the provisions of FIN 46(R) to
unregistered investment companies, and extends the scope exception from
applying FIN 46(R) to include registered investment companies. FSP FIN
46(R)-7 is effective upon adoption of SOP 07-1. We are evaluating the effect of
adopting FSP FIN 46(R)-7 on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
SAB
108. In September 2006,
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 specifies how the
carryover or reversal of prior-year unrecorded financial statement
misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current-year misstatement.
SAB 108 requires an approach that considers the amount by which the
current-year statement of income is misstated (rollover approach) and an
approach that considers the cumulative amount by which the current-year
statement of financial condition is misstated (iron-curtain approach). Prior
to the issuance of SAB 108, either the rollover or iron-curtain approach was
acceptable for assessing the materiality of financial statement misstatements.
SAB 108 became effective for our fiscal year ended November 30, 2006. Upon
adoption, SAB 108 allowed a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained
earnings at December 1, 2005 for prior-year misstatements that were not
material under a prior approach but that were material under the SAB 108
approach. Adoption of SAB 108 did not affect our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
SAB
109. In November 2007,
the SEC issued SAB No. 109, Written Loan Commitments
Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings (SAB 109). SAB 109
supersedes SAB No. 105, Loan Commitments Accounted
for as Derivative Instruments (SAB 105), and expresses the view
consistent with the guidance in SFAS 156 and SFAS 159, that the expected net
future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be
included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted
for at fair value through earnings. SAB 105 also expressed the view that
internally-developed intangible assets (such as customer relationship
intangible assets) should not be recorded as part of the fair value of a
derivative loan commitment. SAB 109 retains that view and broadens its
application to all written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair
value through earnings. Adoption of SAB 109 did not have a material affect on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.

The ASF Framework. On December 6, 2007, the
American Securitization Forum (ASF), working with various constituency groups
as well as representatives of U.S. federal government agencies, issued the Streamlined Foreclosure and Loss Avoidance Framework for Securitized
Subprime Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans (the ASF Framework). The
ASF Framework provides guidance for servicers to streamline borrower evaluation
procedures and to facilitate the use of foreclosure and loss prevention efforts
in an attempt to reduce the number of U.S. subprime residential mortgage
borrowers who might default in the coming year because the borrowers cannot
afford to pay the increased loan interest rate after their U.S. subprime
residential mortgage variable loan rate resets. The ASF Framework requires a
borrower and its U.S. subprime residential mortgage variable loan to meet
specific conditions to qualify for a modification under which the qualifying
borrowers loans interest rate would be kept at the existing rate, generally
for five years following an upcoming reset period.
 
-79-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations
 
The ASF Framework is focused on U.S. subprime first-lien adjustable-rate
residential mortgages that have an initial fixed interest rate period of 36
months or less, are included in securitized pools, were originated between January 1,
2005 and July 31, 2007, and have an initial interest rate reset date
between January 1, 2008 and July 31, 2010 (defined as Segment 2
Subprime ARM Loans within the ASF Framework).
 
On January 8, 2008, the SECs Office of Chief Accountant (the OCA)
issued a letter (the OCA Letter) addressing accounting issues that may be
raised by the ASF Framework. Specifically, the OCA Letter expressed the view
that if a Segment 2 Subprime ARM Loan is modified pursuant to the ASF Framework
and that loan could legally be modified, the OCA will not object to continued
status of the transferee as a QSPE under SFAS 140. Concurrent with the issuance
of the OCA Letter, the OCA requested the FASB to immediately address the issues
that have arisen in the application of the QSPE guidance in SFAS 140. Any loan
modifications we make in accordance with the ASF Framework will not have a
material affect on our accounting for U.S. subprime residential mortgage loans
nor securitizations or retained interests in securitizations of U.S. subprime
residential mortgage loans.
 
Basel II. As of December 1, 2005, Holdings became regulated by
the SEC as a CSE. This supervision imposes group-wide supervision and
examination by the SEC, minimum capital requirements on a consolidated basis
and reporting (including reporting of capital adequacy measurement consistent
with the standards adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision) and
notification requirements.
 
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published an updated framework
to calculate risk-based capital requirements in June 2004 (Basel II). In
September 2006, U.S. federal bank regulators announced their intent to
implement Basel II in the U.S. On December 10, 2007, the U.S. federal bank
regulators published final rules implementing the Basel II framework for
the calculation of minimum capital requirements. Within the minimum capital
requirements, or first pillar of Basel II, the federal rules deal only
with the capital risk or banking book component. U.S. federal bank regulators
have indicated that final rules to update market risk or trading book rules will
be issued in the near future.
 
Basel II is meant to be applied on a consolidated basis for banking
institutions or bank holding companies that have consolidated total assets of
$250 billion or more and/or consolidated total on-balance-sheet foreign
exposure of $10 billion or more. Basel II provides two broad methods for
calculating minimum capital requirements related to credit risk (i) a
standardized approach that relies heavily upon external credit assessments by
major independent credit rating agencies; and (ii) an internal
ratings-based approach that permits the use of internal rating assessments in
determining required capital.
 
The time frame in which Basel II requirements would become effective for
U.S. banking institutions or bank holding companies is contemplated to be (i) one
or more years of parallel calculation, in which an entity would remain subject
to existing risk-based capital rules but also calculate its risk-based
capital requirements under the new Basel II framework; and (ii) two or
three transition years, during which an entity would be subject to the new
framework and an entitys minimum risk-based capital would be subject to a
floor.
 
The Basel II framework is
anticipated to impact our minimum capital requirements and reporting (including
reporting of capital adequacy measurements) as a CSE.
 

Effects of
Inflation

 
Because our assets are, to a large extent, liquid in nature, they are not
significantly affected by inflation. However, the rate of inflation affects
such expenses as employee compensation, office space leasing costs and
communications charges, which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of
services we offer. To the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and
has other adverse effects on the securities markets, it may adversely affect
our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in certain
businesses.

LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
Managements Assessment of
Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
The management of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (the Company) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting. The Companys internal control system is designed to
provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and Board of Directors
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
published financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have
inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective
can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
preparation and presentation.
 
The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2007. In making
this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
ControlIntegrated Framework. Based on our assessment we believe
that, as of November 30, 2007, the Companys internal control over
financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.
 
-82-





 
LEHMAN
BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
 
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
 
To The Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
 
We have audited Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc.s (the Company) internal control over financial
reporting as of November 30, 2007, based on criteria established in
Internal ControlIntegrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). The Companys
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements
Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our audit.
 
We conducted our audit in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed
risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
A companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
 
Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
 
In our opinion, the
Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of November 30, 2007, based on the COSO criteria.
 
We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the consolidated statement of financial condition of the
Company as of November 30, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2007 of the Company
and our report dated January 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

LEHMAN BROTHERS

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm
 
To The Board of Directors and
Stockholders of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
 
We have audited the
accompanying consolidated statement of financial condition of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (the Company) as of November 30, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders equity, and
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 30,
2007. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the
Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the
responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
We conducted our audits
in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
 
In our opinion, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
at November 30, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 30,
2007, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also,
in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in
all material respects the information set forth therein.
 
We also have audited, in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States), the effectiveness of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.s internal
control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2007, based on
criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report
dated January 28, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

the Company, the Firm, Lehman Brothers, we, us or our) serves the
financial needs of corporations, governments and municipalities, institutional
clients and high net worth individuals worldwide with business activities
organized in three segments, Capital Markets, Investment Banking and Investment
Management. Founded in 1850, Lehman Brothers maintains market presence in
equity and fixed income sales, trading and research, investment banking, asset
management, private investment management and private equity. The Firm is
headquartered in New York, with regional headquarters in London and Tokyo, and
operates in a network of offices in North America, Europe, the Middle East,
Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. We are a member of all principal
securities and commodities exchanges in the U.S., and we hold memberships or
associate memberships on several principal international securities and
commodities exchanges, including the London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Frankfurt,
Paris, Milan and Australian stock exchanges.
 
Basis of Presentation
 
The Consolidated
Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles and include the accounts of Holdings, our subsidiaries,
and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest or are
considered to be the primary beneficiary. All material inter-company accounts
and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation. Certain prior-period
amounts reflect reclassifications to conform to the current years
presentation.
 
On April 5, 2006, the stockholders of Holdings approved an increase
of its authorized shares of common stock to 1.2 billion from 600 million, and
the Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 common stock split, in the form of a
stock dividend, that was effected on April 28, 2006. All share and per
share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted for the increase in authorized
shares and the stock split. For additional information about the stock split,
see Note 11, Earnings per Common Share, and Note 12, Share-Based Employee Incentive Plans, to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
Use of Estimates
 
In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes,
management makes various estimates that
affect reported amounts and disclosures. Broadly, those estimates are used in:
 
·                  measuring fair value
of certain financial instruments;
 
·                  accounting for
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill;
 
·                  establishing
provisions for potential losses that may arise from litigation, regulatory
proceedings and tax examinations;
 
·                  assessing our ability
to realize deferred taxes; and
 
·                  valuing equity-based
compensation awards.
 
Estimates are based on available information and judgment. Therefore,
actual results could differ from our estimates and that difference could have a
material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.
 
Consolidation Policies
 
The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Holdings and
the entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. We
determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by
first determining whether the entity is a voting interest entity (sometimes
referred to as a non-VIE), a variable interest entity (VIE) or a qualified
special purpose entity (QSPE).
 
Voting Interest Entity. Voting interest entities are
entities that have (i) total equity investment at risk sufficient to fund
expected future operations independently; and (ii) equity holders who have
the obligation to absorb losses or receive residual returns and the right to
make decisions about the entitys activities. In accordance with Accounting
Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51, Consolidated Financial
Statements, and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned Subsidiaries,
voting interest entities are consolidated when the Company has a controlling
financial interest, typically more than 50 percent of an entitys voting
interests.
 
Variable Interest Entity. VIEs are entities that lack one or
more voting interest entity characteristics. The Company consolidates VIEs in
which it is the primary beneficiary. In accordance with Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 46-R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (revised December 2003)an
interpretation of
 
-92-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
ARB No. 51 (FIN 46(R)), we are the primary beneficiary if we
have a variable interest, or a combination of variable interests, that will
either (i) absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses; (ii) receive
a majority of the VIEs expected residual returns; or (iii) both. To
determine if we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we review, among other
factors, the VIEs design, capital structure, contractual terms, which
interests create or absorb variability and related party relationships, if any.
Additionally, we may calculate our share of the VIEs expected losses and
expected residual returns based upon the VIEs contractual arrangements and/or
our position in the VIEs capital structure. This type of analysis is typically
performed using expected cash flows allocated to the expected losses and
expected residual returns under various probability-weighted scenarios.
 
Qualified Special Purpose Entity. QSPEs are passive entities with
limited permitted activities. SFAS No. 140, Accounting
for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
Liabilities-a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125 (SFAS 140),
establishes the criteria an entity must satisfy to be a QSPE, including types
of assets held, limits on asset sales, use of derivatives and financial
guarantees, and discretion exercised in servicing activities. In accordance
with SFAS 140 and FIN 46(R), we do not consolidate QSPEs.
 
For a further discussion of our involvement with VIEs, QSPEs and other
entities see Note 6, Securitizations and Special Purpose Entities, to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Equity-Method Investments. Entities in which we do not have a
controlling financial interest (and therefore do not consolidate) but in which
we exert significant influence (generally defined as owning a voting interest
of 20 percent to 50 percent, or a partnership interest greater than 3 percent)
are accounted for either under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18,
The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in
Common Stock or SFAS No. 159, The Fair
Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS
159). For further discussion of our adoption of SFAS 159, see Accounting and
Regulatory DevelopmentsSFAS 159 below.
 
Other. When we do not consolidate an entity or apply the equity
method of accounting, we present our investment in the entity at fair value. We
have formed various non-consolidated private equity or other alternative
investment funds with third-party investors that are typically organized as
limited partnerships. We typically act as general partner for these funds, and
when third-party investors have (i) rights to either remove the general
partner without cause or to liquidate the partnership; or (ii) substantive
participation rights, we do not consolidate these partnerships in accordance
with Emerging Issue Task Force (EITF) No. 04-5, Determining
Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a
Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain
Rights (EITF 04-5).
 
A determination of whether we have a controlling financial interest in an
entity and therefore our assessment of consolidation of that entity is
initially made at the time we become involved with the entity. Certain events
may occur which cause us to re-assess our initial determination of whether an
entity is a VIE or non-VIE or whether we are the primary beneficiary if the
entity is a VIE and therefore our assessment of consolidation of that entity.
Those events generally are:
 
·                  The entitys
governance structure is changed such that either (i) the characteristics
or adequacy of equity at risk are changed, or (ii) expected returns or
losses are reallocated among the participating parties within the entity.
 
·                  The equity investment
(or some part thereof) is returned to the equity investors and other interests
become exposed to expected returns or losses.
 
·                  Additional activities
are undertaken or assets acquired by the entity that were beyond those
anticipated previously.
 
·                  Participants in the
entity acquire or sell interests in the entity.
 
·                  The entity receives
additional equity at risk or curtails its activities in a way that changes the
expected returns or losses.
 
Currency Translation
 
Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries having nonU.S. dollar
functional currencies are translated at exchange rates at the applicable Consolidated
Statement of Financial Condition date. Revenues and expenses are translated at
average exchange rates during the period. The gains or losses resulting from
translating non-U.S. dollar functional currency into U.S. dollars, net of
hedging gains or losses, are included in Accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss), net of tax, a component of Stockholders equity. Gains or losses
resulting from non-U.S. dollar currency transactions are included in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.
 
Revenue Recognition Policies
 
Principal transactions. Realized and unrealized gains or
losses from Financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and
Financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet purchased,
as well as the gains or losses
 
-93-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
from certain short- and long-term borrowing obligations, principally
certain hybrid financial instruments, and certain deposit liabilities at banks
that we measure at fair value are reflected in Principal transactions in the
Consolidated Statement of Income.
 
Investment banking. Underwriting revenues, net of
related underwriting expenses, and revenues for merger and acquisition advisory
and other investment banking-related services are recognized when services for
the transactions are completed. In instances where our Investment Banking
segment provides structuring services and/or advice in a capital
markets-related transaction, we record a portion of the transaction-related
revenue as Investment Banking fee revenues.
 
Commissions. Commissions primarily include fees from executing
and clearing client transactions on equities, options and futures markets
worldwide. These fees are recognized on a trade-date basis.
 
Interest and dividends revenue and interest expense. We recognize
contractual interest on Financial instruments and other inventory positions
owned and Financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but not yet
purchased, excluding derivatives, on an accrual basis as a component of
Interest and dividends revenue and Interest expense, respectively. We account
for our secured financing activities and certain short- and long-term
borrowings on an accrual basis with related interest recorded as interest
revenue or interest expense, as applicable. Contractual interest expense on all
deposit liabilities and certain hybrid financial instruments are recorded as a
component of Interest expense.
 
Asset management and other. Investment advisory fees are
recorded as earned. In certain circumstances, we receive asset management
incentive fees when the return on assets under management exceeds specified
benchmarks. Incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a
twelve-month period and are not subject to adjustment after the measurement
period ends. Accordingly, we recognize incentive fees when the measurement
period ends.
 
We also receive private equity incentive fees when the returns on certain
private equity or other alternative investment funds investments exceed
specified thresholds. Private equity incentive fees typically are based on
investment results over a period greater than one year, and future investment
underperformance could require amounts previously distributed to us to be
returned to the funds. Accordingly, we recognize these incentive fees when all
material contingencies have been substantially resolved.
 
Income Taxes
 
We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. We recognize the current and
deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the
financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Deferred tax
assets are recognized for temporary differences that will result in deductible
amounts in future years and for tax loss carry-forwards. We record a valuation
allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that more likely than not
will be realized. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary
differences that will result in taxable income in future years. Contingent
liabilities related to income taxes are recorded when probable and reasonably
estimable in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting
for Contingencies.
 
For a discussion of the impact of FIN 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxesan Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), see Accounting and Regulatory DevelopmentsFIN 48 below.
 
Share-Based Compensation
 
On December 1, 2003, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions
of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation (SFAS 123), using the prospective adoption method.
Under this method of adoption, compensation expense was recognized over the
related service periods based on the fair value of stock options and restricted
stock units (RSUs) granted for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005. Under SFAS 123,
stock options granted in periods prior to fiscal 2004 continued to be accounted
for under the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. Accordingly, under
SFAS 123 no compensation expense was recognized for stock option awards granted
prior to fiscal 2004 because the exercise price equaled or exceeded the market
value of our common stock on the grant date.
 
On December 1, 2005, we
adopted SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS 123(R))
using the modified-prospective transition method. Under this transition method,
compensation cost recognized during fiscal 2006 includes: (i) compensation
cost for all share-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of, December 1,
2005, (including pre-fiscal-2004 options) based on the grant-date fair value
and related service period estimates in accordance with the original provisions
of SFAS 123; and (ii) compensation cost for all share-based awards granted
subsequent to December 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value and
related service periods estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS
123(R). Under the provisions of the modified-prospective transition method,
results for fiscal 2005 were not restated.
 
SFAS 123(R) clarifies and
expands the guidance in SFAS 123 in several areas, including how to measure
fair value and how to attribute compensation cost to reporting periods. Changes
to the SFAS 123 fair value measurement and service
 
-94-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
period provisions prescribed by
SFAS 123(R) include requirements to: (i) estimate forfeitures of
share-based awards at the date of grant, rather than recognizing forfeitures as
incurred as was permitted by SFAS 123; (ii) expense share-based awards
granted to retirement-eligible employees and those employees with
non-substantive non-compete agreements immediately, while our accounting
practice under SFAS 123 was to recognize such costs over the stated service
periods; (iii) attribute compensation costs of share-based awards to the
future vesting periods, while our accounting practice under SFAS 123 included a
partial attribution of compensation costs of share-based awards to services
performed during the year of grant; and (iv) recognize compensation costs
of all share-based awards (including amortizing pre-fiscal-2004 options) based
on the grant-date fair value, rather than our accounting methodology under SFAS
123 which recognized pre-fiscal-2004 option awards based on their intrinsic
value.
 
Prior to adopting SFAS 123(R) we presented the cash flows related
to income tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized on stock
issued under RSUs and stock options exercised during the period (excess tax
benefits) as operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.
SFAS 123(R) requires excess tax benefits to be classified as financing
cash flows. In addition, as a result of
adopting SFAS 123(R), certain balance sheet amounts associated with share-based
compensation costs have been reclassified within the equity section of the
balance sheet. This change in presentation had no effect on our total equity.
Effective December 1, 2005, Deferred stock compensation (representing
unearned costs of RSU awards) and Common stock issuable are presented on a net
basis as a component of Additional paid-in capital. See Accounting and
Regulatory DevelopmentsSFAS 123(R) below for a further discussion of SFAS 123(R)
and the cumulative effect of this accounting change recognized in fiscal 2006.
 
Earnings per Share
 
We compute earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with SFAS No. 128,
Earnings per Share. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income applicable to common
stock by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, which
includes RSUs for which service has been provided. Diluted EPS includes the
components of basic EPS and also includes the dilutive effects of RSUs for
which service has not yet been provided and employee stock options.
 
Financial Instruments and Other Inventory Positions
 
Financial instruments and other inventory positions
owned, excluding real estate held for sale, and Financial instruments and other
inventory positions sold but not yet purchased are carried at fair value. Real
estate held for sale is accounted for at the lower of its carrying amount or
fair value less cost to sell. For further discussion of our financial
instruments and other inventory positions, see Note 3, Financial Instruments
and Other Inventory Positions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
Firm-owned securities pledged to counterparties who
have the right, by contract or custom, to sell or repledge the securities are
classified as Financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and are
disclosed as pledged as collateral. For further discussion of our securities
received and pledged as collateral, see Note 5, Securities Received and
Pledged as Collateral, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
We adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value
Measurements (SFAS 157) effective December 1, 2006. SFAS 157
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid
to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. When observable prices are not available, we either
use implied pricing from similar instruments or valuation models based on net
present value of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as appropriate for
liquidity, credit, market and/or other risk factors.
 
Prior to December 1, 2006, we followed the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Audit and
Accounting Guide, Brokers and Dealers in Securities,
when determining fair value for financial instruments, which permitted the
recognition of a discount to the quoted price when determining the fair value
for a substantial block of a particular security, when the quoted price was not
considered to be readily realizable (i.e., a block
discount).
 
For further discussion of our adoption of SFAS 157,
see Accounting and Regulatory DevelopmentsSFAS 157 below.
 
Derivative financial instruments. Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is based on an
underlying asset (e.g.,
Treasury bond), index (e.g.,
S&P 500) or reference rate (e.g., LIBOR), and include futures, forwards, swaps, option contracts, or
other financial instruments with similar characteristics. A derivative contract
generally represents a future commitment to exchange interest payment streams
or currencies based on the contract or notional amount or to purchase or sell
other financial instruments or physical assets at specified terms on a
specified date. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivative products are
privately-negotiated contractual agreements that can be tailored to meet
individual client needs and include forwards, swaps and certain options
including caps, collars and floors. Exchange-traded derivative products are
standardized contracts transacted through regulated exchanges and include
futures and certain option contracts listed on an exchange.
 
-95-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Derivatives are recorded at fair
value and included in either Financial instruments and other inventory
positions owned or Financial instruments and other inventory positions sold but
not yet purchased in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.
Derivatives are presented net-by-counterparty when a legal right of offset
exists; net across different products or positions when applicable provisions
are stated in a master netting agreement; and/or net of cash collateral
received or paid on a counterparty basis, provided legal right of offset
exists.
 
We enter into derivative transactions both in a trading capacity and as an
end-user. Acting in a trading capacity, we enter into derivative transactions
to satisfy the needs of our clients and to manage our own exposure to market
and credit risks resulting from our trading activities (collectively, Trading-Related
Derivatives). For Trading-Related Derivatives, margins on futures contracts
are included in receivables and payables from/to brokers, dealers and clearing
organizations, as applicable.
 
As an end-user, we primarily use derivatives to hedge our exposure to
market risk (including foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks) and
credit risks (collectively, End-User Derivatives). When End-User Derivatives
are interest rate swaps they are measured at fair value through earnings and
the carrying value of the related hedged item is adjusted through earnings for
the effect of changes in the risk being hedged. The hedge ineffectiveness in
these relationships is recorded in Interest expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. When End-User Derivatives are used in hedges of net
investments in non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries, the gains or
losses are reported within Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net
of tax, in Stockholders equity.
 
Prior to December 1, 2006, we followed EITF Issue
No. 02-3, Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative
Contracts Held for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading
and Risk Management Activities (EITF 02-3). Under EITF 02-3,
recognition of a trading profit at inception of a derivative transaction was
prohibited unless the fair value of that derivative was obtained from a quoted
market price supported by comparison to other observable inputs or based on a
valuation technique incorporating observable inputs. Subsequent to the
inception date (Day 1), we recognized trading profits deferred at Day 1 in
the period in which the valuation of the instrument became observable. The
adoption of SFAS 157 nullified the guidance in EITF 02-3 that precluded the
recognition of a trading profit at the inception of a derivative contract,
unless the fair value of such derivative was obtained from a quoted market
price or other valuation technique incorporating observable inputs. For further
discussion of our adoption of SFAS 157, see Accounting and Regulatory
DevelopmentsSFAS 157 below.
 
Securitization activities. In accordance with SFAS 140, we
recognize transfers of financial assets as sales, if control has been
surrendered. We determine control has been surrendered when the following three
criteria have been met:
 
·                  The transferred assets
have been isolated from the transferor  put presumptively beyond the reach of
the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership (i.e., a true sale opinion has been obtained);
 
·                  Each transferee (or,
if the transferee is a QSPE, each holder of its beneficial interests) has the
right to pledge or exchange the assets (or beneficial interests) it received,
and no condition both constrains the transferee (or holder) from taking
advantage of its right to pledge or exchange and provides more than a trivial
benefit to the transferor; and
 
·                  The transferor does
not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (i) an
agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or
redeem them before their maturity or (ii) the ability to unilaterally
cause the holder to return specific assets.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Collateralized Lending Agreements
and Financings
 
Treated as collateralized
agreements and financings for financial reporting purposes are the following:
 
·                  Repurchase and resale agreements. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold
under agreements to repurchase are collateralized primarily by government and
government agency securities and are carried net by counterparty, when permitted,
at the amounts at which the securities subsequently will be resold or
repurchased plus accrued interest. We take possession of securities purchased
under agreements to resell. The fair value of the underlying positions is
compared daily with the related receivable or payable balances, including
accrued interest. We require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or
return collateral pledged, as necessary, to ensure the fair value of the
underlying collateral remains sufficient.
 
·                  Securities borrowed and
securities loaned. Securities
borrowed and securities loaned are carried at the amount of cash collateral
advanced or received plus accrued interest. We value the securities borrowed
and loaned daily and obtain additional cash as necessary to ensure these
transactions are adequately collateralized. When we act as the lender of
securities in a securities-lending agreement and we receive securities that can
be pledged or sold as collateral, we recognize an asset, representing the securities
received and a liability, representing the obligation to return those
securities.
 
·                  Other secured borrowings. Other secured borrowings principally reflect transfers accounted for as
financings rather than sales under SFAS 140. Additionally, Other secured
borrowings includes non-recourse financings of entities that we have
consolidated because we are the primary beneficiaries of such entities.
 
Long-Lived Assets
 
Property, equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at historical
cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is
recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the assets. Buildings are depreciated up to a maximum of 40 years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the lesser of their useful lives or the terms
of the underlying leases, which range up to 30 years. Equipment, furniture and
fixtures are depreciated over periods of up to 10 years. Internal-use software
that qualifies for capitalization under AICPA Statement of Position 98-1, Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for
Internal Use, is capitalized and subsequently amortized over the
estimated useful life of the software, generally three years, with a maximum of
seven years. We review long-lived assets for impairment periodically and
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of
the assets may be impaired. If the expected future undiscounted cash flows are
less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized to
the extent the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value.
 
Identifiable Intangible Assets and Goodwill
 
Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their
expected useful lives, which range up to 15 years. Identifiable intangible
assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are not amortized. Instead, these
assets are evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill is reduced upon
the recognition of certain acquired net operating loss carryforward benefits.
 
Cash Equivalents
 
Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments not held for resale
with maturities of three months or less when we acquire them.
 
Accounting and Regulatory Developments
 
The following summarizes
accounting standards that have been issued during the periods covered by the
Consolidated Financial Statements and the effect of adoption on our results of
operations, if any, actual or estimated.
 
SFAS 123(R). In December 2004,
the FASB issued SFAS 123(R) which established standards of accounting for
transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and
services and focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an
entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. Two key
differences between SFAS 123 and SFAS 123(R) relate to attribution of
compensation costs to reporting periods and accounting for award forfeitures.
SFAS 123(R) generally requires the immediate expensing of equity-based
awards granted to retirement-eligible employees or awards granted subject to
substantive non-compete agreements to be expensed over the non-compete period.
SFAS 123(R) also requires expected forfeitures to be included in
determining stock-based employee compensation expense. We adopted SFAS 123(R) as
of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year and recognized an after-tax gain of
approximately $47 million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle attributable to the requirement to estimate forfeitures at the date
of grant instead of recognizing them as incurred. For additional information,
see Share-

Based Compensation above and Note 12, Share-Based Employee Incentive
Plans, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
SFAS 155. In
February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an
amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 (SFAS 155),
which permits an entity to measure at fair value any hybrid financial
instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require
bifurcation. As permitted, we early adopted SFAS 155 in the first quarter of
2006. The effect of adoption resulted in a $24 million after-tax ($43 million
pre-tax) decrease to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of our 2006
fiscal year, representing the difference between the fair value of these hybrid financial instruments and the prior
carrying value as of November 30, 2005.
 
SFAS 156. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156,
Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets an
amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 156), which permits
entities to elect to measure servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair
value and report changes in fair value in earnings. As a result of adopting
SFAS 156, we recognized an $18 million after-tax ($33 million pre-tax) increase
to opening retained earnings in our 2006 fiscal year.
 
SFAS
157. In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS 157. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value, outlines a fair value hierarchy based on inputs used
to measure fair value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value
measurements. SFAS 157 does not change existing guidance as to whether or not
an instrument is carried at fair value.
 
SFAS 157 also (i) nullifies
the guidance in EITF 02-3 that precluded the recognition of a trading profit at
the inception of a derivative contract, unless the fair value of such
derivative was obtained from a quoted market price or other valuation technique
incorporating observable inputs; (ii) clarifies that an issuers credit
standing should be considered when measuring liabilities at fair value; (iii) precludes
the use of a liquidity or block discount when measuring instruments traded in
an active market at fair value; and (iv) requires costs related to
acquiring financial instruments carried at fair value to be included in
earnings as incurred.
 
We elected to early adopt SFAS 157 at the beginning of
our 2007 fiscal year and we recorded the difference between the carrying
amounts and fair values of (i) stand-alone derivatives and/or certain
hybrid financial instruments measured using the guidance in EITF 02-3 on
recognition of a trading profit at the inception of a derivative, and (ii) financial
instruments that are traded in active markets that were measured at fair value
using block discounts, as a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained
earnings. As a result of adopting SFAS 157, we recognized a $45 million
after-tax ($78 million pre-tax) increase to opening retained earnings. For
additional information regarding our adoption of SFAS 157, see Note 4, Fair
Value of Financial Instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
SFAS
158. In September 2006,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for
Defined Benefit Pension and Other Retirement Plans (SFAS 158),
which requires an employer to recognize the over- or under-funded status of its
defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition,
measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the
benefit obligation. For pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected
benefit obligation; while for other postretirement plans the benefit obligation
is the accumulated postretirement obligation. Upon adoption, SFAS 158 requires
an employer to recognize previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and
prior service costs within Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (net
of tax), a component of Stockholders equity. In accordance with the
guidance in SFAS No. 158, we adopted this provision of the standard for
the year ended November 30, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 158
reduced Accumulated other comprehensive income/ (loss), by $210 million
after-tax ($344 million pre-tax) at November 30, 2007.
 
SFAS
159. In February 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS 159 which permits certain financial assets and financial
liabilities to be measured at fair value, using an instrument-by-instrument
election. The initial effect of adopting SFAS 159 must be accounted for as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings for the fiscal year
in which we apply SFAS 159. Retrospective application of SFAS 159 to fiscal
years preceding the effective date is not permitted.
 
We elected to early adopt SFAS 159 beginning in our
2007 fiscal year and to measure at fair value substantially all hybrid
financial instruments not previously accounted for at fair value under SFAS No. 155, as
well as certain deposit liabilities at our U.S. banking subsidiaries. We
elected to adopt SFAS 159 for these instruments to reduce the complexity of
accounting for these instruments under SFAS No. 133, Accounting
for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. As a result of
adopting SFAS 159, we recognized a $22 million after-tax increase ($35 million
pre-tax) to opening retained earnings as of December 1, 2006, representing
the effect of changing the measurement basis of these financial instruments
from an adjusted amortized cost basis at November 30, 2006 to fair value.
 
SFAS 141(R). In December 2007, the FASB issued
SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations
(SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) expands the definition of transactions and
events that qualify as business combinations; requires that the acquired
 
-98-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
assets and liabilities, including contingencies, be
recorded at the fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes
thereafter reflected in revenue, not goodwill; changes the recognition timing
for restructuring costs; and requires acquisition costs to be expensed as
incurred. Adoption of SFAS 141(R) is required for combinations after December 15,
2008. Early adoption and retroactive application of SFAS 141(R) to fiscal
years preceding the effective date are not permitted. We are evaluating the
impact of adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
SFAS
160. In December 2007,
the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in
Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS 160). SFAS 160
re-characterizes minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries as
non-controlling interests and requires the classification of minority interests
as a component of equity. Under SFAS 160, a change in control will be measured
at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. The effective date
for SFAS 160 is for annual periods beginning on or after December 15,
2008. Early adoption and retroactive application of SFAS 160 to fiscal years
preceding the effective date are not permitted. We are evaluating the impact of
adoption on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
FIN 48. In June 2006, the FASB issued FIN
48, which sets out a framework for management to use to determine the
appropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax positions. This
interpretation of SFAS 109 uses a two-step approach wherein a tax benefit is
recognized if a position is more likely than not to be sustained, and the
amount of benefit is then measured on a probabilistic approach, as defined in
FIN 48. FIN 48 also sets out disclosure requirements to enhance transparency of
an entitys tax reserves. We must adopt FIN 48 as of the beginning of our 2008
fiscal year. We estimate that the effect of adopting FIN 48 at the beginning of
the first quarter of 2008 to be a decrease to opening retained earnings of
approximately $190 million.
 
SOP
07-1. In June 2007,
the AICPA issued Statement of Position (SOP) No. 07-1, Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide Investment
Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and Equity Method Investors for
Investments in Investment Companies (SOP 07-1). SOP 07-1 addresses
when the accounting principles of the AICPA Audit and Accounting Guide
Investment Companies must be applied by an entity and whether those accounting
principles must be retained by a parent company in consolidation or by an
investor in the application of the equity method of accounting. SOP 07-1 is
effective for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2008. We are
evaluating the effect of adopting SOP 07-1 on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
EITF Issue No. 04-5. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the
consensus reached in EITF 04-5 which requires general partners (or managing
members in the case of limited liability companies) to consolidate their
partnerships or to provide limited partners with either (i) rights to
remove the general partner without cause or to liquidate the partnership; or (ii) substantive
participation rights. As the general partner of numerous private equity and
asset management partnerships, we adopted EITF 04-5 effective June 30,
2005 for partnerships formed or modified after June 29, 2005. For
partnerships formed on or before June 29, 2005 that had not been modified,
we adopted EITF 04-5 as of the beginning of our 2007 fiscal year. The adoption
of EITF 04-5 did not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
FSP
FIN 46(R)-6. In
April 2006, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) FIN 46(R)-6, Determining the Variability to Be Considered in Applying FASB
Interpretation No. 46(R) (FSP FIN 46(R)-6). This FSP
addresses how a reporting enterprise should determine the variability to be
considered in applying FIN 46(R) by requiring an analysis of the purpose
for which an entity was created and the variability that the entity was
designed to create. We adopted FSP FIN 46(R)-6 on September 1, 2006 and
applied it prospectively to all entities in which we first became involved
after that date. Adoption of FSP FIN 46(R)-6 did not have a material effect on
our Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
FSP
FIN 39-1. In April 2007,
the FASB directed the FASB Staff to issue FSP No. FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39 (FSP FIN 39-1).
FSP FIN 39-1 modifies FIN No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts
Related to Certain Contracts, and permits companies to offset cash
collateral receivables or payables with net derivative positions under certain
circumstances. FSP FIN 39-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
2007, with early adoption permitted. FSP FIN 39-1 does not affect our
Consolidated Financial Statements because it clarified the acceptability of
existing market practice, which we use, of netting cash collateral against net
derivative assets and liabilities.
 
FSP
FIN 48-1. In May 2007,
the FASB directed the FASB Staff to issue FSP No. FIN 48-1, Definition of Settlement In FASB Interpretation No. 48
(FSP FIN 48-1). Under FSP FIN 48-1, a previously unrecognized tax benefit may
be subsequently recognized if the tax position is effectively settled and other
specified criteria are met. We are evaluating the effect of adopting FSP FIN
48-1 on our Consolidated Financial Statements as part of our evaluation of the
effect of adopting FIN 48.
 
FSP
FIN 46(R)-7.
In May 2007, the FASB directed the FASB Staff to issue FSP No. FIN
46(R)-7, Application of FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) to
Investment Companies (FSP FIN 46(R)-7). FSP FIN 46(R)-7 makes
permanent the temporary deferral of the application of the provisions of FIN 46(R) to
unregistered investment companies, and extends the scope exception from
applying FIN 46(R) to include registered investment companies. FSP FIN
46(R)-7 is effective upon

adoption of SOP 07-1. We
are evaluating the effect of adopting FSP FIN 46(R)-7 on our Consolidated
Financial Statements.
 
SAB
108. In September 2006,
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin
(SAB) No. 108, Considering the Effects of
Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year
Financial Statements (SAB 108). SAB 108 specifies how the
carryover or reversal of prior-year unrecorded financial statement
misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current-year misstatement.
SAB 108 requires an approach that considers the amount by which the
current-year statement of income is misstated (rollover approach) and an
approach that considers the cumulative amount by which the current-year
statement of financial condition is misstated (iron-curtain approach). Prior
to the issuance of SAB 108, either the rollover or iron-curtain approach was
acceptable for assessing the materiality of financial statement misstatements.
SAB 108 became effective for our fiscal year ended November 30, 2006. Upon
adoption, SAB 108 allowed a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained
earnings at December 1, 2005 for prior-year misstatements that were not
material under a prior approach but that were material under the SAB 108
approach. Adoption of SAB 108 did not affect our Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
SAB
109. In November 2007,
the SEC issued SAB No. 109, Written Loan Commitments
Recorded at Fair Value Through Earnings (SAB 109). SAB 109
supersedes SAB No. 105, Loan Commitments Accounted
for as Derivative Instruments (SAB 105), and expresses the view,
consistent with the guidance in SFAS 156 and SFAS 159, that the expected net
future cash flows related to the associated servicing of the loan should be
included in the measurement of all written loan commitments that are accounted
for at fair value through earnings. SAB 105 also expressed the view that internally-developed
intangible assets (such as customer relationship intangible assets) should not
be recorded as part of the fair value of a derivative loan commitment. SAB 109
retains that view and broadens its application to all written loan commitments
that are accounted for at fair value through earnings. Adoption of SAB 109 did
not have a material affect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The ASF Framework. On December 6, 2007, the
American Securitization Forum (ASF), working with various constituency groups
as well as representatives of U.S. federal government agencies, issued the Streamlined Foreclosure and Loss Avoidance Framework for Securitized
Subprime Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans (the ASF Framework). The
ASF Framework provides guidance for servicers to streamline borrower evaluation
procedures and to facilitate the use of foreclosure and loss prevention efforts
in an attempt to reduce the number of U.S. subprime residential mortgage
borrowers who might default in the coming year because the borrowers cannot
afford to pay the increased loan interest rate after their U.S. subprime
residential mortgage variable loan rate resets. The ASF Framework requires a
borrower and its U.S. subprime residential mortgage variable loan to meet
specific conditions to qualify for a modification under which the qualifying
borrowers loans interest rate would be kept at the existing rate, generally
for five years following an upcoming reset period. The ASF Framework is focused
on U.S. subprime first-lien adjustable-rate residential mortgages that have an
initial fixed interest rate period of 36 months or less, are included in
securitized pools, were originated between January 1, 2005 and July 31,
2007, and have an initial interest rate reset date between January 1, 2008
and July 31, 2010 (defined as Segment 2 Subprime ARM Loans within the
ASF Framework).
 
On January 8, 2008, the SECs Office of Chief Accountant (the OCA)
issued a letter (the OCA Letter) addressing accounting issues that may be
raised by the ASF Framework. Specifically, the OCA Letter expressed the view
that if a Segment 2 Subprime ARM Loan is modified pursuant to the ASF Framework
and that loan could legally be modified, the OCA will not object to continued
status of the transferee as a QSPE under SFAS 140. Concurrent with the issuance
of the OCA Letter, the OCA requested the FASB to immediately address the issues
that have arisen in the application of the QSPE guidance in SFAS 140. Any loan
modifications we make in accordance with the ASF Framework will not have a

material affect on our accounting for U.S. subprime residential mortgage
loans nor securitizations or retained interests in securitizations of U.S.
subprime residential mortgage loans.
 
Basel II. As of December 1, 2005, Holdings became regulated by
the SEC as a consolidated supervised entity (CSE). This supervision imposes
group-wide supervision and examination by the SEC, minimum capital requirements
on a consolidated basis and reporting (including reporting of capital adequacy
measurement consistent with the standards adopted by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision) and notification requirements.
 
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published an updated framework
to calculate risk-based capital requirements in June 2004 (Basel II). In
September 2006, U.S. federal bank regulators announced their intent to
implement Basel II in the U.S. On December 10, 2007, the U.S. federal bank
regulators published final rules implementing the Basel II framework for
the calculation of minimum capital requirements. Within the minimum capital
requirements, or first pillar of Basel II, the federal rules deal only
with the capital risk or banking book component. U.S. federal bank regulators
have indicated that final rules to update market risk or trading book rules will
be issued in the near future.
 
Basel II is meant to be applied on a consolidated basis for banking
institutions or bank holding companies that have consolidated total assets of
$250 billion or more and/or consolidated total on-balance-sheet foreign
exposure of $10 billion or more. Basel II provides two broad methods for
calculating minimum capital requirements related to credit risk (i) a
standardized approach that relies heavily upon external credit assessments by
major independent credit rating agencies; and (ii) an internal
ratings-based approach that permits the use of internal rating assessments in
determining required capital.
 
The time frame in which Basel II
requirements would become effective for U.S. banking institutions or bank
holding companies is contemplated to be (i) one or more years of parallel
calculation, in which an entity would remain subject to existing risk-based
capital rules but also calculate its risk-based capital requirements under
the new Basel II framework; and (ii) two or three transition years, during
which an entity would be subject to the new framework and an entitys minimum
risk-based capital would be subject to a floor.
 
The Basel II framework is
anticipated to impact our minimum capital requirements and reporting (including
reporting of capital adequacy measurements) as a CSE.
 

Note 2 Business Segments and Geographic Information

 
Business Segments
 
We organize our business operations into three business segments: Capital
Markets, Investment Banking and Investment Management.
 
Our business segment information for the periods ended in 2007, 2006 and
2005 is prepared using the following methodologies and generally represents the
information that is relied upon by management in its decision-making processes:
 
·                  Revenues and expenses
directly associated with each business segment are included in determining
income before taxes.
 
·                  Revenues and expenses
not directly associated with specific business segments are allocated based on
the most relevant measures applicable, including each segments revenues,
headcount and other factors.
 
·                  Net revenues include
allocations of interest revenue, interest expense and revaluation of certain
long-term and short-term debt measured at fair value to securities and other
positions in relation to the cash generated by, or funding requirements of, the
underlying positions.
 
·                  Business segment
assets include an allocation of indirect corporate assets that have been fully
allocated to our segments, generally based on each segments respective
headcount figures.
 
Capital Markets. Our Capital Markets segment is
divided into two components:
 
Fixed Income  We make markets in and trade municipal and public sector
instruments, interest rate and credit products, mortgage-related securities and
loan products, currencies and commodities. We also originate mortgages and we
structure and enter into a variety of derivative transactions. We also provide
research covering economic, quantitative, strategic, credit, relative value,
index and portfolio analyses. Additionally, we provide financing, advice and
servicing activities to the hedge fund community, known as prime brokerage
services. We engage in certain proprietary trading activities and in principal
investing in real estate that are managed within this component.
 
-101-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.

Net Revenues by Geographic Region
 
We organize our operations into three geographic regions:
 
·                  Europe and the Middle
East, inclusive of our operations in Russia and Turkey;
 
·                  Asia-Pacific,
inclusive of our operations in Australia and India; and
 
·                  the Americas.
 
Net revenues presented by geographic region are based upon the location of
the senior coverage banker or investment advisor in the case of Investment
Banking or Asset Management, respectively, or where the position was risk
managed within Capital Markets and Private Investment Management. Certain
revenues associated with U.S. products and services that result from
relationships with international clients have been classified as international
revenues using an allocation process. In addition, expenses contain certain
internal allocations, such as regional transfer pricing, which are centrally
managed. The methodology for allocating the firms revenues and expenses to
geographic regions is dependent on the judgment of management.
 
The following presents, in managements judgment, a reasonable
representation of each regions contribution to our operating results.

Mortgage and asset-backed securities. Mortgage and
asset-backed securities include residential and commercial whole loans and
interests in residential and commercial mortgage-backed securitizations. Also
included within Mortgage and asset-backed securities are securities whose cash
flows are based on pools of assets in bankruptcy-remote entities, or
collateralized by cash flows from a specified pool of underlying assets. The
pools of assets may include, but are not limited to mortgages, receivables and
loans.
 
It is our intent to sell through securitization or syndication activities,
residential and commercial mortgage whole loans we originate, as well as those
we acquire in the secondary market. We originated approximately $47 billion and
$60 billion of residential mortgage loans in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and
approximately $60 billion and $34 billion of commercial mortgage loans in 2007
and 2006, respectively.
 
Balances reported for Mortgage and asset-backed securities include
approximately $12.8 billion and $5.5 billion in 2007 and 2006, respectively, of
loans transferred to securitization vehicles where such transfers were
accounted for as secured financings rather than sales under SFAS 140. The
securitization vehicles issued securities that were distributed to investors.
We do not consider ourselves to have economic exposure to the underlying assets
in those securitization vehicles. For further discussion of our securitization
activities, see Note 6, Securitizations and Special Purpose Entities, to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In 2007 and 2006, our inventory of Mortgage and asset-backed securities,
excluding those that were accounted for as financings rather than sales under
SFAS 140, generally included the following types of assets:

were accounted for as financings rather than sales under SFAS 140 which were approximately
$2.9 billion and $3.0 billion at November 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
Government and agencies. Included within these balances are
instruments issued by a national government or agency thereof, denominated in
the countrys own currency or in a foreign currency (e.g.,
sovereign) as well as municipals.
 
Corporate debt and other. Longer-term debt instruments,
generally with a maturity date falling at least a year after their issue date,
not issued by governments and may or may not be traded on major exchanges, are
included within this component.
 
Non-derivative, physical commodities are reported as a component of this
line item and were approximately $308 million in 2007. In 2006, we did not have
any non-derivative, physical commodities.
 
Corporate equities. Balances generally reflect held
positions in any instrument that has an equity ownership component, such as
equity-related positions, public ownership equity securities that are listed on
public exchanges, private equity-related positions and non-public ownership
equity securities that are not listed on a public exchange.
 
Real estate held for sale. Real estate held for sale of
$21.9 billion and $9.4 billion at November 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, reflects our investments in parcels of land and related physical
property. We invest in entities whose underlying assets are Real estate held
for sale. We consolidate those entities in which we are the primary beneficiary
in accordance with FIN 46(R). We do not consider ourselves to have economic
exposure to the total underlying assets in those entities. Our net investment
positions related to Real estate held for sale, excluding the amounts that have
been consolidated but for which we do not consider ourselves to have economic
exposure, was $12.8 billion and $5.9 billion at November 30, 2007 and
2006, respectively.
 
Commercial paper and other money market instruments. Commercial paper and
other money market instruments include short-term obligations, generally issued
by financial institutions or corporations, with maturities within a calendar
year of the financial statement date. These instruments may include promissory
notes, drafts, checks and certificates of deposit.
 
Derivatives
and other contractual agreements. These balances generally represent future commitments to exchange
interest payment streams or currencies based on contract or notional amounts or
to purchase or sell other financial instruments or physical assets at specified
terms on a specified date. Both over-the-counter and exchange-traded
derivatives are reflected.
 
The following table presents the fair value of Derivatives and other
contractual agreements at November 30, 2007 and 2006. Assets included in
the table represent unrealized gains, net of unrealized losses, for situations
in which we have a master netting agreement. Similarly, liabilities represent
net amounts owed to counterparties. The fair value of derivative contracts
represents our net receivable/payable for derivative financial instruments
before consideration of securities collateral. Asset and liabilities are
presented below net of cash collateral of approximately $19.7 billion and $17.5
billion, respectively, at November 30, 2007 and $11.1 billion and $8.2
billion, respectively, at November 30, 2006.
 

1                   We generally define
U.S. subprime residential mortgage loans as those associated with borrowers
having a credit score in the range of 620 or lower using the Fair Isaac
Corporations statistical model, or having other negative factors within their
credit profiles. Prior to its closure in our third quarter, we originated
subprime residential mortgage loans through BNC Mortgage LLC (BNC), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of our U.S. regulated thrift Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB.
BNC served borrowers with subprime qualifying credit profiles but also served
borrowers with stronger credit history as a result of broker relationships or
product offerings and such loans are also included in our subprime business
activity. For residential mortgage loans purchased from other mortgage
originators, we use a similar subprime definition as for our origination
activity. Additionally, second lien loans are included in our subprime business
activity.

for OTC contracts is $34.6 billion and $15.6 billion at November 30, 2007
and 2006, respectively, representing the fair value of OTC contracts in a net
receivable position, after consideration of collateral.
 
At November 30, 2007, our Derivatives and other contractual
agreements include approximately $1.5 billion of both commodity derivative
assets and liabilities. At November 30, 2006, our commodity derivative
assets and liabilities were $268 million and liabilities of $277 million,
respectively.
 
Concentrations of Credit Risk
 
A substantial portion of
our securities transactions are collateralized and are executed with, and on
behalf of, financial institutions, which includes other brokers and dealers,
commercial banks and institutional clients. Our exposure to credit risk
associated with the non-performance of these clients and counterparties in
fulfilling their contractual obligations with respect to various types of
transactions can be directly affected by volatile or illiquid trading markets,
which may impair the ability of clients and counterparties to satisfy their
obligations to us.
 
Financial instruments and
other inventory positions owned include U.S. government and agency securities,
and securities issued by non-U.S. governments, which in the aggregate
represented 6% and 9% of total assets at November 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. In addition, collateral held for resale agreements represented
approximately 24% and 23% of total assets at November 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, and primarily consisted of securities issued by the U.S.
government, federal agencies or non-U.S. governments. Our most significant
industry concentration is financial institutions, which includes other brokers
and dealers, commercial banks and institutional clients. This concentration
arises in the normal course of business.
 

Note 4 Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 
Financial instruments and other inventory positions owned, excluding Real
estate held for sale, and Financial instruments and other inventory positions
sold but not yet purchased, are presented at fair value. In addition, certain
long and short-term borrowing obligations, principally certain hybrid financial
instruments, and certain deposit liabilities at banks, are presented at fair
value.
 
Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in
a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. A liabilitys
fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the
liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the
liability with the creditor. Where available, fair value is based on observable
market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where
observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied.
These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and
judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the
instruments or market and the instruments complexity.
 
Beginning December 1, 2006, assets and liabilities recorded at fair
value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition are categorized
based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure
their fair value. Hierarchical levels  defined by SFAS 157 and directly
related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair
valuation of these assets and liabilities  are as follows:
 
Level I  Inputs are unadjusted,
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the
measurement date.
 
-106-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
The types of assets and liabilities
carried at Level I fair value generally are G-7 government and agency
securities, equities listed in active markets, investments in publicly traded
mutual funds with quoted market prices and listed derivatives.
 
Level II  Inputs (other than
quoted prices included in Level I) are either directly or indirectly observable
for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the
measurement date and for the duration of the instruments anticipated life.
 
Fair valued assets and liabilities
that are generally included in this category are non-G-7 government securities,
municipal bonds, certain hybrid financial instruments, certain mortgage and
asset backed securities, certain corporate debt, certain commitments and
guarantees, certain private equity investments and certain derivatives.
 
Level III  Inputs reflect
managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk
inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the
model.
 
Generally, assets and liabilities
carried at fair value and included in this category are certain mortgage and
asset-backed securities, certain corporate debt, certain private equity
investments, certain commitments and guarantees and certain derivatives.
 
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
 
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are
categorized in the tables below based upon the lowest level of significant
input to the valuations.

Gains and Losses
 
Net revenues (both realized and unrealized) for Level III financial
instruments are a component of Principal transactions in the Consolidated
Statement of Income. Net realized gains associated with Level III financial
instruments were approximately $1.3 billion for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2007. The net unrealized loss on Level III non-derivative financial instruments
was approximately $2.5 billion for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2007, primarily consisting of unrealized losses from mortgage and asset-backed
positions. The net unrealized gain on Level III derivative financial

instruments was approximately $1.6 billion for the fiscal year ended November 30,
2007, primarily consisting of unrealized gains from equity and interest
rate-related derivative positions. Level III financial instruments may be
economically hedged with financial instruments not classified as Level III;
therefore, gains or losses associated with Level III financial instruments are
offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in
other levels of the fair value hierarchy.
 
The table presented below summarizes the change in balance sheet carrying
values associated with Level III financial instruments during the fiscal year
ended November 30, 2007. Caution should be utilized when evaluating
reported net revenues for Level III Financial instruments. The values presented
exclude economic hedging activities that may be transacted in instruments
categorized within other fair value hierarchy levels. Actual net revenues
associated with Level III financial instruments inclusive of hedging activities
could differ materially.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Fair Value Option
 
SFAS 159 permits certain financial assets and liabilities to be measured
at fair value, using an instrument-by-instrument election. Changes in the fair
value of the financial assets and liabilities for which the fair value option
was made are reflected in Principal transactions in our Consolidated Statement
of Income. As indicated above in the fair value hierarchy tables and further
discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Accounting
and Regulatory DevelopmentsSFAS 159,
we elected to account for the following financial assets and liabilities at
fair value:
 
Certain hybrid financial instruments. These instruments are primarily
structured notes that are risk managed on a fair value basis and within our
Capital Market activities and for which hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133,
Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities, had been complex to maintain. Changes in the fair value
of these liabilities, excluding any Interest income or Interest expense, are
reflected in Principal transactions in our Consolidated Statement of Income. We
calculate the impact of our own credit spread on hybrid financial instruments
carried at fair value by discounting future cash flows at a rate which
incorporates observerable changes in our credit spread. The estimated changes
in the fair value of these liabilities were gains of approximately $1.3
billion, attributable to the widening of our credit spreads during fiscal year
2007. As of November 30, 2007, the aggregate principal amount of hybrid
financial instruments classified as short-term borrowings and measured at fair
value exceeded the fair value by approximately $152 million. Additionally and
as of November 30, 2007, the aggregate principal amount of hybrid
financial instruments classified as long-term borrowings and measured at fair
value exceeded the fair value by approximately $2.1 billion.
 
Other secured borrowings. Certain liabilities recorded as
Other secured borrowings include the proceeds received from transferring loans
to securitization vehicles where such transfers were accounted for as secured
financings rather than sales under SFAS 140. The transferred loans are
reflected as an asset within Mortgages and asset-backed positions and also
accounted for at fair value and categorized as Level II in the fair value
hierarchy. We do not consider ourselves to have economic exposure to the
underlying assets in these securitization vehicles. The change in fair value
attributable to the observable impact from instrument-specific credit risk was
not material to our results of operations.
 
Deposit liabilities at banks. We elected to account for certain
deposits at our U.S. banking subsidiaries at fair value. The change in fair
value attributable to the observable impact from instrument-specific credit
risk was not material to our results of operations. As of November 30,
2007, the difference between the fair value and the aggregate principal amount
of deposit liabilities at banks carried at fair value was not material.
 
Liabilities for which the fair value option was elected are categorized in
the table below based upon the lowest level of significant input to the
valuations.

Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
 
The Company uses fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis in its assessment
of assets classified as Goodwill and other inventory positions classified as
Real estate held for sale. These assets and inventory positions are recorded at
fair value initially and assessed for impairment periodically thereafter.
During the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007, the carrying amount of
Goodwill assets were compared to their fair value. No change in carrying amount
resulted in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Additionally and on a
nonrecurring basis during the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007, the
carrying amount of Real estate held for sale positions were compared to their
fair value less cost to sell. No change in carrying amount resulted in
accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 66, Accounting
for Sales of Real Estate, SFAS No. 144, Accounting
for Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, and other relevant
accounting guidance. The lowest level of inputs for fair value measurements for
Goodwill and Real estate held for sale are Level III.
 
For additional information regarding Goodwill, see Note 7, Identifiable
Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For
additional information regarding our inventory of Real estate held for sale,
see Note 3, Financial Instruments and Other Inventory Positions, to the

Valuation Techniques
 
In accordance with SFAS 157, valuation techniques used for assets and
liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three
types:
 
Market Approach. Market approach valuation
techniques use prices and other relevant information from market transactions
involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Valuation techniques
consistent with the market approach include comparables and matrix pricing.
Comparables use market multiples, which might lie in ranges with a different
multiple for each comparable. The selection of where within the range the
appropriate multiple falls requires judgment, considering both quantitative and
qualitative factors specific to the measurement. Matrix pricing is a
mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities without
relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but comparing
the securities to benchmark or comparable securities.
 
Income Approach. Income approach valuation
techniques convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single
present amount, or a discounted amount. These techniques rely on current market
expectations of future amounts. Examples of income approach valuation
techniques include present value techniques; option-pricing models, binomial or
lattice models that incorporate present value techniques; and the multi-period
excess earnings method.
 
Cost Approach. Cost approach valuation techniques
are based upon the amount that, at present, would be required to replace the
service capacity of an asset, or the current replacement cost. That is, from
the perspective of a market participant (seller), the price that would be
received for the asset is determined based on the cost to a market participant
(buyer) to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility.
 
The three approaches described within SFAS 157 are consistent with
generally accepted valuation methodologies. While all three approaches are not
applicable to all assets or liabilities accounted for at fair value, where appropriate
and possible, one or more valuation techniques may be used. The selection of
the valuation method(s) to apply considers the definition of an exit price
and the nature of the asset or liability being valued and significant expertise
and judgment is required. For assets and liabilities accounted for at fair
value, excluding Goodwill and Real estate held for sale, valuation techniques
are generally a combination of the market and income approaches. Goodwill and
Real estate held for sale valuation techniques generally combine income and
cost approaches. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007, the
application of valuation techniques applied to similar assets and liabilities
has been consistent.
 

Note 5 Securities Received and Pledged as Collateral

 
We enter into secured borrowing and lending transactions to finance
inventory positions, obtain securities for settlement and meet clients needs.
We receive collateral in connection with resale agreements, securities borrowed
transactions, borrow/pledge transactions, client margin loans and derivative
transactions. We generally are permitted to sell or repledge these securities
held as collateral and use them to secure repurchase agreements, enter into
securities lending transactions or deliver to counterparties to cover short
positions.
 
At November 30, 2007 and 2006, the fair value of securities received
as collateral that we were permitted to sell or repledge was approximately $798
billion and $621 billion, respectively. The fair value of securities received
as collateral that we sold or repledged was approximately $725 billion and $568
billion at November 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
We also pledge our own assets, primarily to collateralize certain
financing arrangements. These pledged securities, where the counterparty has
the right by contract or custom to sell or repledge the financial instruments,
were approximately $63 billion and $43 billion at November 30, 2007 and
2006, respectively. The carrying value of Financial instruments and other inventory
positions owned that have been pledged or otherwise encumbered to
counterparties where those counterparties do not have the right to sell or
repledge, was approximately $87 billion and $75 billion at November 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively.
 

Note 6 Securitizations and Special Purpose Entities

 
Generally, residential and commercial mortgages, home equity loans,
municipal and corporate bonds, and lease and trade receivables are financial
assets that we securitize through SPEs. We may continue to hold an interest in
the financial assets securitized in the form of the securities created in the
transaction, including residual interests (interests in securitizations)
established to facilitate the securitization transaction. Interests in
securitizations are presented within Financial instruments and other inventory
positions owned (primarily in mortgages and asset-backed securities and
government and agencies) in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.

For the periods ended November 30, 2007 and 2006, we securitized the

At November 30, 2007 and 2006, we had approximately $1.6 billion and
$2.0 billion, respectively, of non-investment grade interests from our
securitization activities.
 
The table below presents: the fair value of our interests in
securitizations at November 30, 2007 and 2006; model assumptions of market
factors, sensitivity of valuation models to adverse changes in the assumptions,
as well as cash flows received on such interests in the securitizations. The
sensitivity analyses presented below are hypothetical and should be used with
caution since the stresses are performed without considering the effect of
hedges, which serve to reduce our actual risk. We mitigate the risks associated
with the below interests in securitizations through various risk management
dynamic hedging strategies. These results are calculated by stressing a
particular economic assumption independent of changes in any other assumption
(as required by U.S. GAAP). In reality, changes in one factor often result in
changes in another factor which may counteract or magnify the effect of the
changes outlined in the table below. Changes in the fair value based on a 10%
or 20% variation in an assumption should not be extrapolated because the
relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may
not be linear.

Mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)
represent the right to future cash flows based upon contractual servicing fees
for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Our MSRs generally arise
from the securitization of residential mortgage loans that we originate. MSRs
are presented within Financial instruments and other inventory positions owned
on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. Effective with the
adoption of SFAS 156 as of the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, MSRs are
carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in earnings in the
period in which the change occurs. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, the
Company had MSRs of approximately $1.2 billion and $829 million, respectively.
Our MSRs activities for the year ended November 30, 2007 and 2006 are as
follows:

The
determination of MSRs fair value is based upon a discounted cash flow valuation
model. Cash flow and prepayment assumptions used in our discounted cash flow
model are: based on empirical data drawn from the historical performance of our
MSRs; consistent with assumptions used by market participants valuing similar
MSRs; and from data obtained on the performance of similar MSRs. These
variables can, and generally will, vary from quarter to quarter as market
conditions and projected interest rates change. For that reason, risk related
to MSRs directly correlates to changes in prepayment speeds and discount rates.
We mitigate this risk by entering into hedging transactions.
 
The following table shows the main
assumptions used to determine the fair value of our MSRs at November 30,
2007 and 2006, the sensitivity of our MSRs fair value measurements to changes
in these assumptions, and cash flows received on contractual servicing:

The above sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and should be used with
caution since the stresses are performed without considering the effect of
hedges, which serve to reduce our actual risk. These results are calculated by
stressing a particular economic assumption independent of changes in any other
assumption (as required by U.S. GAAP). In reality, changes in one factor often

relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not
be linear.
 
Non-QSPE activities. We have transactional activity
with SPEs that do not meet the QSPE criteria because their permitted activities
are not limited sufficiently or the assets are non-qualifying financial
instruments (e.g., real estate). These SPEs
issue credit-linked notes, invest in real estate or are established for other
structured financing transactions designed to meet clients investing or
financing needs.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
A collateralized debt obligation (CDO) transaction involves the purchase
by an SPE of a diversified portfolio of securities and/or loans that are then
managed by an independent asset manager. Interests in the SPE (debt and equity)
are sold to third party investors. Our primary role in a CDO is to act as
structuring and placement agent, warehouse provider, underwriter and market
maker in the related CDO securities. In a typical CDO, at the direction of a
third party asset manager, we will temporarily warehouse securities or loans on
our balance sheet pending the sale to the SPE once the permanent financing is
completed. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, we owned approximately $581.2
million and $55.1 million of equity securities in CDOs, respectively. Because
our investments do not represent a majority of the CDOs equity, we are not
exposed to the majority of the CDOs expected losses. Accordingly, we are not
the primary beneficiary of the CDOs and therefore we do not consolidate them.
 
As a dealer in credit default swaps, we make a market in buying and
selling credit protection on single issuers as well as on portfolios of credit
exposures. We mitigate our credit risk, in part, by purchasing default
protection through credit default swaps with SPEs. We pay a premium to the SPEs
for assuming credit risk under the credit default swap. In these transactions,
SPEs issue credit-linked notes to investors and use the proceeds to invest in
high quality collateral. Our maximum potential loss associated with our
involvement with such credit-linked note transactions is measured by the fair
value of our credit default swaps with such SPEs. At November 30, 2007 and
2006, respectively, the fair values of these credit default swaps were $3.9
billion and $155 million. The underlying investment grade collateral held by
SPEs where we are the first-lien holder was $15.7 billion and $10.8 billion at November 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
Because the investors assume default risk associated with both the
reference portfolio and the SPEs assets, our expected loss calculations
generally demonstrate the investors in the SPEs bear a majority of the entitys
expected losses. Accordingly, we generally are not the primary beneficiary and
therefore do not consolidate these SPEs. In instances where we are the primary
beneficiary of the SPEs, we consolidate the SPEs. At November 30, 2007 and
2006, we consolidated approximately $180 million and $718 million of these
SPEs, respectively. The assets associated with these consolidated SPEs are
presented as a component of Financial instruments and other inventory positions
owned, and the liabilities are presented as a component of Other secured
borrowings.
 
We also invest in real estate directly through consolidated subsidiaries
and through VIEs. We consolidate our investments in real estate VIEs when we
are the primary beneficiary. We record the assets of these consolidated real
estate VIEs as a component of Financial instruments and other inventory positions
owned, and the liabilities are presented as a component of Other secured
borrowings. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, we consolidated approximately
$9.8 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, of real estate-related
investments. After giving effect to non-recourse financing, our net investment
position in these consolidated real estate VIEs was $6.0 billion and $2.2
billion at November 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

(2)     Certain borrowings and deposit liabilities at banks are carried
at fair value in accordance with SFAS 155, SFAS 157 and SFAS 159. For
additional information, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting
Polices, and Note 4, Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to the

about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, the carrying amount of
our total long-term borrowings can be approximated at fair value using a
discounted cash flow valuation model with inputs of quoted market prices for
similar types of borrowing arrangements. The estimated fair value of our
long-term borrowings at November 30, 2007 was approximately $4.8 billion
less than the carrying amount. The estimated fair value of our long-term
borrowings at November 30, 2006 was approximately $250 million more than
the carrying amount.

At November 30, 2007, $863 million of outstanding long-term
borrowings are repayable at par value prior to maturity at the option of the
holder. These obligations are reflected in the above table as maturing at their
put dates, which range from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2022, rather than at their
contractual maturities, which range from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2031. In
addition, $20.2 billion of long-term borrowings are redeemable prior to
maturity at our option under various terms and conditions. These obligations
are reflected in the above table at their contractual maturity dates, which
range from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2054, rather than at their call dates which
range from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2027. Extendible debt structures totaling
approximately $5.4 billion are shown in the above table at their earliest
maturity dates, which range from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2013. Extendible debt
matures on an initial specified maturity date unless the debt holders elect to
extend the term of the note for a period specified in the note.
 
Included in long-term borrowings is $5.1 billion of certain hybrid
financial instruments with early redemption features linked to market prices or
other triggering events (e.g., the
downgrade of a reference obligation underlying a creditlinked note). In the
above maturity table, these notes are shown at their contractual maturity dates.
 
At November 30, 2007, our U.S. dollar and nonU.S. dollar debt
portfolios included approximately $12.9 billion and $16.9 billion,
respectively, of certain hybrid financial instruments for which the interest
rates and/or redemption values are linked to the performance of an underlying
measure (including industry baskets of stocks, commodities or credit events).
Generally, such notes are issued as floating rate notes or the interest rates
on such index notes are effectively converted to floating rates based primarily
on LIBOR through the use of derivatives.
 
EndUser Derivative Activities
 
We use a variety of derivative products including interest rate and
currency swaps as an end-user to modify the interest rate characteristics of
our long-term borrowings portfolio. We use interest rate swaps to convert a
substantial portion of our fixed-rate debt to floating interest rates to more
closely match the terms of assets being funded and to minimize interest rate
risk. In addition, we use crosscurrency swaps to hedge our exposure to foreign
currency risk arising from our nonU.S. dollar debt obligations, after
consideration of nonU.S. dollar assets that are funded with long-term debt
obligations in the same currency. In certain instances, we may use two or more derivative
contracts to manage the interest rate nature and/or currency exposure of an
individual long-term borrowings issuance.

leading rating agencies (subject to limitation). The Trusts were formed for the
purposes of: (i) issuing securities representing ownership interests in
the assets of the Trusts; (ii) investing the proceeds of the Trusts in
junior subordinated notes of Holdings; and (iii) engaging in activities
necessary and incidental thereto. The securities issued by the Trusts are

The trust preferred securities issued by Holdings
Capital Trust VII and Holdings Capital Trust VIII were issued together with
contracts to purchase depositary shares representing our Non-Cumulative
Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series H and Series I, respectively, with
an aggregate redemption value of $1.5 billion. The stock purchase date is
expected to be on or around May 31, 2012, but could occur on an earlier
date or be deferred until as late as May 31, 2013 in certain circumstances.
 
Credit Facilities
 
We use both committed and uncommitted bilateral and
syndicated long-term bank facilities to complement our long-term debt issuance.
In particular, Holdings maintains a $2.0 billion unsecured, committed revolving
credit agreement with a syndicate of banks which expires in February 2009.
In addition, we maintain a $2.5 billion multi-currency unsecured, committed
revolving credit facility (European Facility) with a syndicate of banks for
Lehman Brothers Bankhaus AG (Bankhaus) and Lehman Brothers Treasury Co. B.V.
which expires in April 2010. Our ability to borrow under such facilities
is conditioned on complying with customary lending conditions and covenants. We
have maintained compliance with the material covenants under these credit
agreements at all times. We draw on both of these facilities from time to time
in the normal course of conducting our business. As of November 30, 2007,
there were no outstanding borrowings against either Holdings credit facility
or the European Facility.

We use various hedging and funding strategies to actively manage our
market, credit and liquidity exposures on these commitments. We do not believe
total commitments necessarily are indicative of actual risk or funding
requirements because the commitments may not be drawn or fully used and such
amounts are reported before consideration of hedges.
 
Lending commitments. Through our high grade (investment
grade) and high yield (non-investment grade) sales, trading and underwriting
activities, we make commitments to extend credit in loan syndication
transactions. These commitments and any related drawdowns of these facilities
typically have fixed maturity dates and are contingent on certain
representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the
borrower. We define high yield exposures as securities of or loans to companies
rated BB+ or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies,
as well as non-rated securities or loans that, in managements opinion, are
non-investment grade.
 
We had commitments to high grade borrowers at November 30, 2007 and
2006 of $24.0 billion (net credit exposure of $12.2 billion, after
consideration of hedges) and $17.9 billion (net credit exposure of $4.9
billion, after consideration of hedges), respectively. We had commitments to
high yield borrowers of $14.1 billion (net credit exposure of $12.8 billion,
after consideration of hedges) and $7.6 billion (net credit exposure of $5.9
billion, after consideration of hedges) at November 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.
 
Contingent acquisition facilities. We provide contingent commitments
to investment and non-investment grade counterparties related to acquisition
financing. We do not believe contingent acquisition commitments are necessarily
indicative of actual risk or funding requirements as funding is dependent upon
both a proposed transaction being completed and the acquiror fully utilizing
our commitment. Typically, these commitments are made to a potential acquiror
in a proposed acquisition, which may or may not be completed depending on
whether the potential acquiror to whom we have provided our commitment is
successful. A contingent borrowers ability to draw on the commitment is
typically subject to there being no material adverse change in the borrowers
financial condition, among other factors, and the commitments also generally
contain certain flexible pricing features to adjust for changing market
conditions prior to closing. In addition, acquirers generally utilize multiple
financing sources, including other investment and commercial banks, as well as
accessing the general capital markets for completing transactions. Therefore,
our contingent acquisition commitments are generally greater than the amounts
we ultimately expect to fund. Further, our past practice, consistent with our
credit facilitation framework, has been to syndicate acquisition financings to
investors. The ultimate timing, amount and pricing of a syndication, however,
is influenced by market conditions that may not necessarily be consistent with
those at the time the commitment was entered. We provided
contingent commitments to high grade counterparties related to acquisition
financing of approximately $10.2 billion and $1.9 billion at November 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively, and to high yield counterparties related to
acquisition financing of approximately $9.8 billion and $12.8 billion at November 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
Mortgage commitments. Through our mortgage origination
platforms we make commitments to extend mortgage loans. At November 30,
2007 and 2006, we had outstanding mortgage commitments of approximately $7.4
billion and $12.2 billion, respectively. These commitments included $3.0
billion and $7.0 billion of residential mortgages in 2007 and 2006 and $4.4
billion and $5.2 billion of commercial mortgages at 2007 and 2006. Typically,
residential mortgage loan 
 
-119-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
commitments require us to originate mortgage loans at the option of a
borrower generally within 90 days at fixed interest rates. Consistent with past
practice, our intention is to sell residential mortgage loans, once originated,
primarily through securitizations. The ability to sell or securitize mortgage
loans, however, is dependent on market conditions.
 
Secured lending transactions. In connection with our financing
activities, we had outstanding commitments under certain collateralized lending
arrangements of approximately $9.8 billion and $7.5 billion at November 30,
2007 and 2006, respectively. These commitments require borrowers to provide
acceptable collateral, as defined in the agreements, when amounts are drawn
under the lending facilities. Advances made under these lending arrangements
typically are at variable interest rates and generally provide for
over-collateralization. In addition, at November 30, 2007, we had
commitments to enter into forward starting secured resale and repurchase
agreements, primarily secured by government and government agency collateral,
of $70.8 billion and $45.3 billion, respectively, compared to $44.4 billion and
$31.2 billion, respectively, at November 30, 2006.

(1)                We believe the fair
value of these derivative contracts is a more relevant measure of the
obligations because we believe the notional amount overstates the expected
payout. At November 30, 2007 and 2006, the fair value of these derivatives
contracts approximated $36.8 billion and $9.3 billion, respectively.
Derivative contracts. Under FASB
Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of
Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45), derivative contracts are
considered to be guarantees if such contracts require us to make payments to
counterparties based on changes in an underlying instrument or index (e.g., security prices, interest rates, and currency rates)
and include written credit default swaps, written put options, written foreign
exchange and interest rate options. Derivative contracts are not considered
guarantees if these contracts are cash settled and we cannot determine if the
derivative counterparty held the contracts underlying instruments at
inception. We have determined these conditions have been met for certain large
financial institutions. Accordingly, when these conditions are met, we have not
included these derivatives in our guarantee disclosures.
 
At November 30, 2007 and 2006, the maximum payout value of derivative
contracts deemed to meet the FIN 45 definition of a guarantee was approximately
$737.9 billion and $534.6 billion, respectively. For purposes of determining
maximum payout, notional values are used; however, we believe the fair value of
these contracts is a more relevant measure of these obligations because we
believe the notional amounts greatly overstate our expected payout. At November 30,
2007 and 2006, the fair value of such derivative contracts approximated $36.8
billion and $9.3 billion, respectively. In addition, all amounts included above
are before consideration of hedging transactions. We substantially mitigate our
risk on these contracts through hedges, using other derivative contracts and/or
cash instruments. We manage risk associated with derivative guarantees
consistent with our global risk management policies.
 
Municipal-securities-related commitments. At November 30,
2007 and 2006, we had municipal-securities-related commitments of approximately
$6.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, which are principally comprised of
liquidity commitments related to trust certificates backed by high grade
municipal securities. We believe our liquidity commitments to these trusts
involve a low level of risk because our obligations are supported by high grade
securities and generally cease if the underlying assets are downgraded below
investment grade or upon an issuers default. In certain instances, we also
provide credit default protection to investors, which approximated $468 million
and $48 million at November 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively.
 
Other commitments with VIEs. We make certain liquidity
commitments and guarantees to VIEs. We provided liquidity commitments of
approximately $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion at November 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, which represented our maximum exposure to loss, to commercial
paper conduits in support of certain clients secured financing 
 
-120-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
transactions. However, we believe our actual risk to be limited because
these liquidity commitments are supported by over-collateralization with
investment grade collateral.
 
In addition, we provide limited downside protection guarantees to
investors in certain VIEs by guaranteeing return of their initial principal
investment. Our maximum exposure to loss under such commitments was
approximately $6.1 billion and $3.9 billion at November 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. We believe our actual risk to be limited because our obligations
are collateralized by the VIEs assets and contain significant constraints
under which downside protection will be available (e.g.,
the VIE is required to liquidate assets in the event certain loss levels are
triggered).
 
We participate in an A-1/P-1-rated multi-seller conduit. This multi-seller
issues secured liquidity notes to provide financing. Our intention is to
utilize this conduit for purposes of funding a portion of our contingent
acquisition commitments. At November 30, 2007, we were contingently
committed to provide $1.6 billion of liquidity if the conduit is unable to
remarket the secured liquidity notes upon their maturity, generally, one year
after a failed remarketing event. This conduit is not consolidated in Holdings
results of operations.
 
Standby letters of credit. At November 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively, we had commitments under letters of credit issued by banks to
counterparties for $1.7 billion and $2.4 billion. We are contingently liable
for these letters of credit which are primarily used to provide collateral for
securities and commodities borrowed and to satisfy margin deposits at option
and commodity exchanges.
 
Private equity and other principal investments. At November 30,
2007 and 2006, we had private equity and other principal investment commitments
of approximately $2.6 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, comprising
commitments to private equity partnerships and other principal investment
opportunities. It has been our past practice to distribute and syndicate
certain of these commitments to our investing clients.
 
Other. In the normal course of business, we provide guarantees to
securities clearinghouses and exchanges. These guarantees generally are
required under the standard membership agreements, such that members are
required to guarantee the performance of other members. To mitigate these
performance risks, the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to
post collateral.
 
In connection with certain asset sales and securitization transactions, we
often make customary representations and warranties about the assets.
Violations of these representations and warranties, such as early payment
defaults by borrowers, may require us to repurchase loans previously sold, or
indemnify the purchaser against any losses. To mitigate these risks, to the extent
the assets being securitized may have been originated by third parties, we
generally obtain equivalent representations and warranties from these third
parties when we acquire the assets. We have established reserves which we
believe to be adequate in connection with such representations and warranties.
 
In the normal course of business, we are exposed to credit and market risk
as a result of executing, financing and settling various client security and
commodity transactions. These risks arise from the potential that clients or
counterparties may fail to satisfy their obligations and the collateral
obtained is insufficient. In such instances, we may be required to purchase or
sell financial instruments at unfavorable market prices. We seek to control these
risks by obtaining margin balances and other collateral in accordance with
regulatory and internal guidelines.
 
Certain of our subsidiaries, as general partners, are contingently liable
for the obligations of certain public and private limited partnerships. In our
opinion, contingent liabilities, if any, for the obligations of such
partnerships will not, in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our
Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition or Consolidated Statement of
Income.
 
In connection with certain acquisitions and strategic investments, we
agreed to pay additional consideration contingent on the acquired entity
meeting or exceeding specified income, revenue or other performance thresholds.
These payments will be recorded as amounts become determinable. Had the
determination dates been November 30, 2007 and 2006, our estimated
obligations related to these contingent consideration arrangements would have
been $420 million and $224 million, respectively.
 
Income Taxes
 
We are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS),
and other tax authorities in major operating jurisdictions such as the United
Kingdom and Japan, and in various states in which the Company has significant
operations, such as New York. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of
additional assessments in each tax jurisdiction and the impact on the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax reserves have been established, which we
believe to be adequate with regards to the potential for additional exposure.
Once established, reserves are adjusted only when additional information is
obtained or an event requiring a change to the reserve occurs. Management
believes the resolution 
 
-121-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
of these uncertain tax positions will not have a material impact on the
financial condition of the Company; however resolution could have an impact on
our effective tax rate in any reporting period.
 
We have completed the appeals process with respect to the 1997 through
2000 IRS examination. Although most issues were settled on a basis acceptable
to us, two issues remain unresolved and will carry into litigation with the
IRS. Based on the strength of its positions, we have not reserved any part of
these issues. The aggregate tax benefits previously recorded with regard to
these two issues is approximately $185 million.
 
The IRS has recently begun an examination with respect to our 2001
through 2005 tax years. The audit is in its initial stages and no adjustments
have been proposed. We believe we are adequately reserved for any issues that
may arise from this audit. The two issues from the 1997 through 2000 cycle
which we plan to litigate also have an impact on the 2001 through 2005 tax
years. The aggregate tax benefit previously recorded with regard to these two
issues is approximately $500 million.
 
Litigation
 
In the normal course of business we have been named as a defendant in a
number of lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings. Such proceedings
include actions brought against us and others with respect to transactions in
which we acted as an underwriter or financial advisor, actions arising out of
our activities as a broker or dealer in securities and commodities and actions
brought on behalf of various classes of claimants against many securities
firms, including us. We provide for potential losses that may arise out of
legal and regulatory proceedings to the extent such losses are probable and can
be estimated. Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome, we
generally have denied, or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny,
liability in all significant cases pending against us, and we intend to defend
vigorously each such case. Based on information currently available, we believe
the amount, or range, of reasonably possible losses in excess of established
reserves not to be material to the Companys Consolidated Financial Condition
or Cash Flows. However, losses may be material to our operating results for any
particular future period, depending on the level of income for such period.
 
Lease Commitments
 
Total rent expense for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $250 million, $181 million
and $167 million, respectively. Certain leases on office space contain
escalation clauses providing for additional payments based on maintenance,
utility and tax increases.
 
Minimum future rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases
(net of subleases of approximately $325 million) and future commitments under
capital leases are as follows:

Note 10 Stockholders Equity

 
On April 5, 2006, our Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 common
stock split, in the form of a stock dividend that was effected on April 28,
2006. Prior period share and earnings per share amounts have been restated to
reflect the split. The par value of the common stock remained at $0.10 per
share. Accordingly, an adjustment from Additional paid-in capital to Common
stock was required to preserve the par value of the post-split shares.
 
Preferred Stock
 
Holdings is authorized to issue a total of 24,999,000 shares of preferred
stock. At November 30, 2007, Holdings had 798,000 shares issued and
outstanding under various series as described below. All preferred stock has a
dividend preference over Holdings common stock in the paying of dividends and
a preference in the liquidation of assets.

time required by law. If dividends payable on any of the Series C, D, F or
G Preferred Stock or on any other equally-ranked series of preferred stock have
not been paid for six or more quarters, whether or not consecutive, the
authorized number of directors of the Company will automatically be increased
by two. The holders of the Series C, D, F or G Preferred Stock will have
the right, with holders of any other equally-ranked series of preferred stock
that have similar voting rights and on which dividends likewise have not been
paid, voting together as a class, to elect two directors to fill such newly created
directorships until the dividends in arrears are paid.
 
Common Stock
 
Dividends declared per common share were $0.60, $0.48 and $0.40 in 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively. During the years ended November 30, 2007,
2006 and 2005, we repurchased or acquired, pursuant to our stock repurchase
program, shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately $3.2
billion, $3.7 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, or $73.85, $69.61, and
$51.59 per share, respectively. These shares were acquired in the open market
and from employees who tendered mature shares to pay for the exercise cost of
stock options or for statutory tax withholding obligations on restricted stock
unit (RSU) issuances or option exercises. For additional information, see
Note 12, Share-Based Employee Incentive PlansStock

In 1997, we established an irrevocable grantor trust (the RSU Trust) to
provide common stock voting rights to employees who hold outstanding RSUs and
to encourage employees to think and act like owners. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, we
transferred 24.5 million, 21.0 million and 22.0 million treasury shares,
respectively, into the RSU Trust. At November 30, 2007, approximately 72.5
million shares were held in the RSU Trust with a total value of approximately
$2.3 billion. These shares are valued at weighted-average grant prices. Shares
transferred to the RSU Trust do not affect the total number of shares used in
the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share because we include
amortized RSUs in the calculations. Accordingly, the RSU Trust has no effect on
total equity, net income, book value per share or earnings per share.

stock split.
 

Note 12 Share-Based Employee Incentive Plans

 
We adopted the fair value recognition provisions for share-based awards
pursuant to SFAS 123(R) effective as of the beginning of the 2006 fiscal
year. For a further discussion, see Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting
PoliciesAccounting and Regulatory Developments, to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.
 
We sponsor several share-based employee incentive plans. Amortization of
compensation costs for grants awarded under these plans was approximately $1.3
billion, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion during 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the Consolidated
Statement of Income for these plans was $515 million, $421 million and $457
million for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Not included in the $1.3 billion
of 2007 amortization expense is $514 million of stock awards granted in December 2007,
which were accrued as compensation expense in fiscal 2007.
 
At November 30, 2007, unrecognized compensation cost related to
non-vested stock option and RSU awards totaled $2.0 billion. The cost of these
non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over the next 9.0 years over a
weighted-average period of 3.8 years.
 
Below is a description of our share-based employee incentive compensation
plans.
 
Share-Based Employee Incentive Plans
 
We sponsor several share-based employee incentive plans. The total number
of shares of common stock remaining available for future awards under these
plans at November 30, 2007, was 82.3 million (not including shares that
may be returned to the Stock Incentive Plan (the SIP) as described below, but
including an additional 0.4 million shares authorized for issuance under the
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 1994 Management Ownership Plan (the 1994 Plan)
that have been reserved solely for issuance in respect of dividends on
outstanding awards under this plan). In connection with awards made under our
share-based employee incentive plans, we are authorized to issue shares of
common stock held in treasury or newly-issued shares.
 
1994
and 1996 Management Ownership Plans and Employee Incentive Plan. The 1994 Plan, the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 1996 Management
Ownership Plan (the 1996 Plan) and the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Employee
Incentive Plan (the EIP) all expired following the completion of their
various terms. These plans provided for the issuance of RSUs, performance stock
units, stock options and other share-based awards to eligible employees. At November 30,
2007, awards with respect to 605.6 million shares of common stock have been
made under these plans, of which 130.3 million are outstanding and 475.3
million have been converted to freely transferable common stock.
 
-124-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
Stock
Incentive Plan. The SIP
has a 10-year term ending in May 2015, with provisions similar to the
previous plans. The SIP authorized the issuance of up to the total of (i) 95.0
million shares (20.0 million as originally authorized, plus an additional 75.0
million authorized by the stockholders of Holdings at its 2007 Annual Meeting),
plus (ii) the 33.5 million shares authorized for issuance under the 1996
Plan and the EIP that remained unawarded upon their expiration, plus (iii) any
shares subject to repurchase or forfeiture rights under the 1996 Plan, the EIP
or the SIP that are reacquired by the Company, or the award of which is
canceled, terminates, expires or for any other reason is not payable, plus (iv) any
shares withheld or delivered pursuant to the terms of the SIP in payment of any
applicable exercise price or tax withholding obligation. Awards with respect to
51.1 million shares of common stock have been made under the SIP as of November 30,
2007, 50.4 million of which are outstanding.
 
1999
Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 1999 Neuberger Berman Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (the LTIP)
provides for the grant of restricted stock, restricted units, incentive stock,
incentive units, deferred shares, supplemental units and stock options. The
total number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the LTIP is 15.4 million. At November 30, 2007, awards with respect to
approximately 13.7 million shares of common stock had been made under the LTIP,
of which 3.2 million were outstanding.
 
Restricted Stock Units
 
Eligible employees receive RSUs, in lieu of cash, as a portion of their
total compensation. There is no further cost to employees associated with RSU
awards. RSU awards generally vest over two to five years and convert to
unrestricted freely transferable common stock five years from the grant date.
All or a portion of an award may be canceled if employment is terminated before
the end of the relevant vesting period. We accrue dividend equivalents on
outstanding RSUs (in the form of additional RSUs), based on dividends declared
on our common stock.
 
For RSUs granted prior to 2004, we measured compensation cost based on the
market value of our common stock at the grant date in accordance with APB
Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees, and, accordingly, a discount from the market
price of an unrestricted share of common stock on the RSU grant date was not
recognized for selling restrictions subsequent to the vesting date. For awards
granted beginning in 2004, we measure compensation cost based on the market
price of our common stock at the grant date less a discount for sale restrictions
subsequent to the vesting date in accordance with SFAS 123 and SFAS 123(R). The
fair value of RSUs subject to post-vesting date sale restrictions are generally
discounted by three to eight percent for each year based upon the duration of
the post-vesting restriction. These discounts are based on market-based studies
and academic research on securities with restrictive features. RSUs granted in
each of the periods presented contain selling restrictions subsequent to a
vesting date.
 
The fair value of RSUs converted to common stock without restrictions for
the year ended November 30, 2007 was $1.2 billion. Compensation costs
previously recognized and tax benefits recognized in equity upon issuance of
these awards were approximately $760 million.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
The above table excludes approximately 49.7 million RSUs which were
granted to employees on December 7, 2007, including approximately 11.3
million RSUs awarded to retirement eligible employees and expensed in fiscal
2007 and approximately 38.4 million RSUs awarded to employees and subject to
future vesting provisions.
 
Of the approximately 117.9 million RSUs outstanding at November 30,
2007, approximately 83.1 million were amortized and included in basic earnings
per share. Approximately 16.5 million of RSUs outstanding at November 30,
2007 will be amortized during 2008, and the remainder will be amortized
subsequent to 2008.
 
The above table includes approximately 5.8 million RSUs awarded to certain
senior officers, the terms of which were modified in 2006 (the Modified RSUs).
The original RSUs resulted from performance stock units (PSUs) for which the
performance periods have expired, but which were not previously converted into
RSUs as their vesting was contingent upon a change in control of the Company or
certain other specified circumstances as determined by the Compensation and
Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors (the CIC RSUs). On November 30,
2006, with the approval of the Compensation and Benefits Committee, each
executive agreed to a modification of the vesting terms of the CIC RSUs to
eliminate the change in control provisions and to provide for vesting in ten
equal annual installments from 2007 to 2016, provided the executive continues
to be an employee on the vesting date of the respective installment. Vested installments
will remain subject to forfeiture for detrimental behavior for an additional
two years, after which time they will convert to common stock on a one-for-one
basis and be issued to the executive. The Modified RSUs will vest (and convert
to common stock and be issued) earlier only upon death, disability or certain
government service approved by the Compensation and Benefits Committee.
Dividends will be payable by the Corporation on the Modified RSUs from the date
of their modification and will be reinvested in additional RSUs with the same
terms.
 
Also included in the previous table are PSUs for which the number of RSUs
to be earned was dependent on achieving certain performance levels within
predetermined performance periods. During the performance period, these PSUs
were accounted for as variable awards. At the end of the performance period,
any PSUs earned converted one-for-one to RSUs that then vest in three or more
years. At November 30, 2006, all performance periods have been completed
and any PSUs earned have been converted into RSUs. The compensation cost for
the RSUs payable in satisfaction of PSUs is accrued over the combined
performance and vesting periods.
 
Stock Options
 
Employees and Directors may receive stock options, in lieu of cash, as a
portion of their total compensation. Such options generally become exercisable
over a one- to five-year period and generally expire five- to ten years from
the date of grant, subject to accelerated expiration upon termination of
employment.
 
We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to measure the grant date
fair value of stock options granted to employees. Stock options granted have
exercise prices equal to the market price of our common stock on the grant
date. The principal assumptions utilized in valuing options and our methodology
for estimating such model inputs include: (i) risk-free interest rate -
estimate is based on the yield of U.S. zero coupon securities with a maturity
equal to the expected life of the option; (ii) expected volatility - estimate
is based on the historical volatility of our common stock for the three years

became freely tradable in 2007 was approximately $23 million.
 
Stock Repurchase Program
 
We maintain a common stock repurchase program to manage our equity
capital. Our stock repurchase program is effected through open-market
purchases, as well as through employee transactions where employees tender
shares of common stock to pay for the exercise price of stock options and the required
tax withholding obligations upon option exercises and conversion of RSUs to
freely-tradable common stock. In January 2007, our Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of up to 100 million
shares of Holdings common stock for the management of our equity capital,
including offsetting dilution due to employee stock awards. This authorization
superseded the stock repurchase program authorized in 2006. During 2007, we
repurchased approximately 34.6 million shares of our common stock through
open-market purchases at an aggregate cost of approximately $2.6 billion, or
$75.40 per share. In addition, we withheld approximately 8.5 million shares of
common stock from employees at an equivalent cost of approximately 
 
-127-





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
$573 million. At November 30, 2007, approximately 57 million shares
remained available for repurchase under this authorization.
 
In January 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase,
subject to market conditions, of up to 100 million shares of Holdings common
stock for the management of the Firms equity capital, including consideration
of dilution due to employee stock awards. This resolution supersedes the stock
repurchase program authorized in 2007.
 

Note 13 Employee Benefit Plans

 
We provide both funded and unfunded noncontributory defined benefit
pension plans for the majority of our employees worldwide. In addition, we provide
certain other postretirement benefits, primarily health care and life
insurance, to eligible employees. We use a November 30 measurement date
for our plans.
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 158, which requires an
employer to recognize the over- or under-funded status of its defined benefit
postretirement plans as an asset or liability in its Consolidated Statement of Financial
Condition, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets
and the benefit obligation. For pension plans, the benefit obligation is the
projected benefit obligation. For other postretirement plans, the benefit
obligation is the accumulated postretirement obligation. Upon adoption, SFAS
158 requires an employer to recognize previously unrecognized actuarial gains
and losses and prior service costs within Accumulated other comprehensive
income/(loss) (net of tax), a component of Stockholders equity. We adopted
this provision of SFAS 158 for the year ended November 30, 2007.
 
The following table illustrates the incremental effect of the
application of SFAS 158 on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition at
November 30, 2007:

Return on Plan Assets
 
U.S. and nonU.S. Plans. Establishing the expected rate of
return on pension assets requires judgment. We consider the following factors
in determining these assumptions:
 
·                 The types of
investment classes in which pension plan assets are invested and the expected
compounded return we can reasonably expect the portfolio to earn over
appropriate time periods. The expected return reflects forward-looking economic
assumptions.
 
·                 The investment returns
we can reasonably expect our active investment management program to achieve in
excess of the returns expected if investments were made strictly in indexed
funds.
 
·                 Investment related
expenses.
 
We review the expected long-term rate of return annually and revise it as
appropriate. Also, we periodically commission detailed asset/liability studies
to be performed by third-party professional investment advisors and actuaries.
These studies project stated future returns on plan assets. The studies
performed in the past support the reasonableness of our assumptions based on
the targeted allocation investment classes and market conditions at the time
the assumptions were established.
 
Plan Assets
 
Pension plan assets are invested with the objective of meeting current
and future benefit payment needs, while

minimizing future contributions.
 
U.S. plans. Plan assets are invested with several investment
managers. Assets are diversified among U.S. and international equity
securities, U.S. fixed income securities, real estate and cash. The plan
employs a mix of active and passive investment management programs. The
strategic target of plan asset allocation is approximately 65% equities and 35%
U.S. fixed income. The investment sub-committee of our pension committee
reviews the asset allocation quarterly and, with the approval of the pension
committee, determines when and how to rebalance the portfolio. The plan does
not have a dedicated allocation to Lehman Brothers common stock, although the
plan may hold a minimal investment in Lehman Brothers common stock as a result
of investment decisions made by various investment managers.
 
NonU.S. plans. NonU.S. pension plan assets are
invested with several investment managers across a range of different asset
classes. The strategic target of plan asset allocation is approximately 75%
equities, 20% fixed income and 5% real estate.

Expected Contributions for the Fiscal Year Ending November 30,

We do not expect it to be necessary to contribute to our U.S. pension
plans in the fiscal year ending November 30, 2008. We expect to contribute
approximately $8 million to our nonU.S. pension plans in the fiscal year
ending November 30, 2008.

Income before taxes included $6.8 billion, $2.7 billion and $1.9 billion
that also were subject to income taxes of foreign jurisdictions for 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively.
 
The income tax provision differs from that computed by using the statutory
federal income tax rate for the reasons shown below:

The provision for income taxes resulted in effective tax rates of 30.3%,
32.9% and 32.5% for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The decrease in the
effective tax rate in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to a more
favorable mix of earnings which resulted in lower tax expense from foreign
operations as compared to the U.S. statutory rate. The increases in the
effective tax rates in 2006 and 2005 compared with the prior years were
primarily due to an increase in level of pretax earnings which minimizes the
impact of certain tax benefit items, and in 2006 a net reduction in certain
benefits from foreign operations, partially offset by a reduction in state and
local taxes due to favorable audit settlements in 2006 and 2005.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
In 2007, we recorded an income tax
benefit of $2 million, and in 2006 and 2005 we recorded income tax charges
of  $2 million and $1 million,
respectively, from the translation of foreign currencies, which was recorded
directly in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Income tax benefits
related to employee stock compensation plans of approximately $434 million,
$836 million and $1.0 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, were
allocated to Additional paid-in capital.
 
Deferred income taxes are provided for
the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their
reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These temporary
differences will result in future income or deductions for income tax purposes
and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when such
items are expected to reverse.
 
Net deferred tax assets are included in
Other assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. At November 30,
2007 and 2006, deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

We have permanently reinvested earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries.
At November 30, 2007, $4.3 billion of accumulated earnings were
permanently reinvested. At current tax rates, additional Federal income taxes
(net of available tax credits) of approximately $1.1 billion would become
payable if such income were to be repatriated.
 
We have approximately $215 million of Federal net operating loss
carryforwards that are subject to separate company limitations. Substantially
all of these net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire between 2023 and
2026. At November 30, 2007, $5 million of the deferred tax asset valuation
allowance relates to Federal net operating loss carryforwards of an acquired
entity that is subject to separate company limitations. If future circumstances
permit the recognition of the acquired tax benefit, goodwill will be reduced.
The remaining deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $268 million relates to
losses from foreign legal entities in which the prospect of future profitability
does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold.
 
We are under continuous examination by the IRS, and other tax authorities
in major operating jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Japan, and in
various states in which the Company has significant operations, such as New
York. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments
in each tax jurisdiction and the impact on the Consolidated Financial
Statements. Tax reserves have been established, which we believe to be adequate
with regards to the potential for additional exposure. Once established,
reserves are adjusted only when additional information is obtained or an event
requiring a change to the reserve occurs. Management believes the resolution of
these uncertain tax positions will not have a material impact on the financial
condition of the Company; however resolution could have an impact on our
effective tax rate in any one particular period.

LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
 
We have completed the appeals process with respect to the 1997 through
2000 IRS examination. Although most issues were settled on a basis acceptable
to us, two issues remain unresolved and will carry into litigation with the
IRS. Based on the strength of its positions, we have not reserved any part of
these issues. The aggregate tax benefits previously recorded with regard to
these two issues is approximately $185 million.
 
The IRS has recently begun an examination with respect to the 2001 through
2005 tax years. The audit is in its initial stages and no adjustments have been
proposed. We believe we are adequately reserved for any issues that may arise
from this audit. The two issues from the 1997 through 2000 cycle which we plan
to litigate also have an impact on the 2001 through 2005 tax years. The
aggregate tax benefit previously recorded with regard to these two issues is
approximately $500 million.
 

Note 15 Regulatory Requirements

 
For regulatory purposes, Holdings and its subsidiaries are referred to
collectively as a CSE. CSEs are supervised and examined by the SEC, which
requires minimum capital standards on a consolidated basis. At November 30,
2007, Holdings was in compliance with the CSE capital requirements and had
allowable capital in excess of the minimum capital requirements on a
consolidated basis.
 
In the United States, Lehman Brothers Inc. (LBI) and Neuberger Berman,
LLC (NB LLC) are registered broker-dealers in the U.S. that are subject to
SEC Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 1.17 of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, which specify minimum net capital requirements for the registrants.
LBI and NB LLC have consistently operated with net capital in excess of their
respective regulatory capital requirements. LBI has elected to calculate its
minimum net capital in accordance with Appendix E of the Net Capital Rule which
establishes alternative net capital requirements for broker-dealers that are
part of CSEs. In addition to meeting the alternative net capital requirements,
LBI is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1 billion and
net capital in excess of $500 million. LBI is also required to notify the SEC
in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $5 billion. As of November 30,
2007, LBI had net capital of approximately $2.7 billion, which exceeded the
minimum net capital requirement by approximately $2.1 billion. As of November 30,
2007, NB LLC had net capital of approximately $188 million, which exceeded the
minimum net capital requirement by approximately $183 million.
 
Lehman Brothers International (Europe) (LB Europe), a United Kingdom
registered broker-dealer and subsidiary of Holdings, is subject to the capital
requirements of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the United Kingdom.
Financial resources, as defined, must exceed the total financial resources
requirement of the FSA. At November 30, 2007, LB Europes financial
resources of approximately $16.2 billion exceeded the minimum requirement by
approximately $3.8 billion. Lehman Brothers Japan (LB Japan), a regulated
broker-dealer, is subject to the capital requirements of the Financial Services
Agency in Japan and the Bank of Japan. At November 30, 2007, LB Japan had
net capital of approximately $1.3 billion, which was approximately $748 million
in excess of Financial Services Agency in Japans required level and
approximately $512 million in excess of Bank of Japans required level.
 
Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (LB Bank), our thrift subsidiary, is regulated
by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Lehman Brothers Commercial Bank (LB
Commercial Bank), our Utah industrial bank subsidiary is regulated by the Utah
Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation. LB Bank and LB Commercial Bank exceeded all regulatory capital
requirements and are considered to be well capitalized as of November 30,
2007. Bankhaus is subject to the capital requirements of the Federal Financial
Supervisory Authority of the German Federal Republic. At November 30,
2007, Bankhaus financial resources exceeded its minimum financial resources
requirement.
 
Certain other subsidiaries are subject to various securities, commodities
and banking regulations and capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the
regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate. At November 30,
2007, these other subsidiaries were in compliance with their applicable local
capital adequacy requirements.
 
In addition, our AAA rated derivatives subsidiaries, Lehman Brothers
Financial Products Inc. (LBFP) and Lehman Brothers Derivative Products Inc. (LBDP),
have established certain capital and operating restrictions that are reviewed
by various rating agencies. At November 30, 2007, LBFP and LBDP each had
capital that exceeded the requirements of the rating agencies.
 
The regulatory rules referred to above, and certain covenants
contained in various debt agreements, may restrict Holdings ability to withdraw
capital from its regulated subsidiaries, which in turn could limit its ability
to pay dividends to shareholders. Holdings fully guarantees the payment of all
liabilities, obligations and commitments of certain of its subsidiaries.

Note 3 Fair Value of Financial Instruments

 
Financial instruments and other inventory positions owned, excluding Real
estate held for sale, and Financial instruments and other inventory positions
sold but not yet purchased, are presented at fair value. In addition, certain
long and short-term borrowing obligations, principally certain hybrid financial
instruments, are presented at fair value.
 
Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged in
a current transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties. A liabilitys
fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the
liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the
liability with the creditor. Where available, fair value is based on observable
market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where
observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied.
These valuation techniques involve some level of management estimation and
judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the
instruments or market and the instruments complexity.
 
Beginning December 1, 2006, assets and liabilities recorded at fair
value in the Condensed Statement of Financial Condition are categorized based
upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their
fair value. Hierarchical levels  defined by SFAS 157 and directly related to
the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of
these assets and liabilities  are as follows:
 
Level I  Inputs are unadjusted,
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the
measurement date.
 
The types of assets and liabilities
carried at Level I fair value generally are G-7 government and agency
securities, equities listed in active markets, investments in publicly traded
mutual funds with quoted market prices and listed derivatives.
 
Level II  Inputs (other than
quoted prices included in Level I) are either directly or indirectly observable
for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement
date and for the duration of the instruments anticipated life.
 
F-5





 
LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT
(Parent Company Only)
 
Fair valued assets and liabilities
that are generally included in this category are non-G-7 government securities,
municipal bonds, certain hybrid financial instruments, certain mortgage and
asset backed securities, certain corporate debt, certain commitments and
guarantees, certain private equity investments and certain derivatives.
 
Level III  Inputs reflect
managements best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the
asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk
inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the
model.
 
Generally, assets and liabilities
carried at fair value and included in this category are certain mortgage and
asset-backed securities, certain corporate debt, certain private equity
investments, certain commitments and guarantees and certain derivatives.
 
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
 
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are
categorized in the tables below based upon the lowest level of significant
input to the valuations.

157, and SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for
Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159), we also
measure certain non-inventory liabilities at fair value.
Level III
Gains and Losses
 
Net revenues (both realized and unrealized) for Level III financial
instruments are a component of Principal transactions and other in the
Condensed Statement of Income. Net realized gains associated with Level III
financial instruments were approximately $345 million for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2007. The net unrealized loss on Level III non-derivative
financial instruments was approximately $273 million for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2007, primarily consisting of unrealized losses from mortgage
and asset-backed positions. The net unrealized loss on Level III derivative
financial instruments was approximately $15 million for the fiscal year ended
November 30, 2007. Level III financial instruments may be economically
hedged with financial instruments not classified as Level III; therefore, gains
or losses associated with Level III financial instruments are offset by gains
or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of
the fair value hierarchy.

The table presented below summarizes the change in balance sheet carrying
values associated with Level III financial instruments during the fiscal year
ended November 30, 2007. Caution should be utilized when evaluating
reported net revenues for Level III Financial instruments. The values presented
exclude economic hedging activities that may be transacted in instruments categorized
within other fair value hierarchy levels. Actual net revenues associated with
Level III financial instruments inclusive of hedging activities could differ
materially.

At November 30, 2007, there is one obligation in the amount of $745
million of outstanding long-term borrowings that is repayable at par value
prior to maturity at the option of the holder. The obligation is reflected in
the above table as maturing at its put date, which is in fiscal 2012, rather
than at its contractual maturity of fiscal 2022. In addition, approximately
$13.0 billion of long-term borrowings are redeemable prior to maturity at our
option under various terms and conditions. These obligations are reflected in
the above table at their contractual maturity dates, which range from fiscal
2009 to fiscal 2054, rather than at their call dates which range from fiscal
2009 to fiscal 2027. Extendible debt structures totaling approximately $2.3
billion are shown in the above table at their earliest maturity dates, which
range from fiscal 2009 to fiscal 2013. Extendible debt matures on an initial
specified maturity date unless the debt holders elect to extend the term of the
note for a period specified in the note.
 
At November 30, 2007, our U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar debt
portfolios included approximately $5.2 billion and $14 million, respectively,
of certain hybrid financial instruments for which the interest rates and/or
redemption values are linked to the performance of an underlying measure
(including industry baskets of stocks, commodities or credit events).
Generally, such notes are issued as floating rate notes or the interest rates
on such index notes are effectively converted to floating rates based primarily
on LIBOR through the use of derivatives.
 
EndUser
Derivative Activities
 
We use a variety of derivative products including interest rate and
currency swaps as an end-user to modify the interest rate characteristics of
our long-term borrowings portfolio. We use interest rate swaps to convert a substantial
portion of our fixed-rate debt to floating interest rates to more closely match
the terms of assets being funded and to minimize interest rate risk. In
addition, we use cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposure to foreign currency
risk arising from our non-U.S. dollar debt obligations, after consideration of
non-U.S. dollar assets that are funded with long-term debt obligations in the
same currency. In certain instances, we may use two or more derivative
contracts to manage the interest rate nature and/or currency exposure of an
individual long-term borrowings issuance.

Credit Facilities
 
We use both committed and uncommitted bilateral and syndicated long-term
bank facilities to complement our long-term debt issuance. In particular,
Holdings maintains a $2.0 billion unsecured, committed revolving credit
agreement with a syndicate of banks which expires in February 2009. Our
ability to borrow under such facilities is conditioned on complying with
customary lending conditions and covenants. We have maintained compliance with
the material covenants under these credit agreements at all times. We draw on
these facilities from time to time in the normal course of conducting our
business. As of November 30, 2007, there were no borrowings against these
facilities.
 

Note 5 Guarantees

 
We guarantee certain long-term borrowings issued by subsidiaries totaling
$34.2 billion and $21.7 billion at November 30, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. In addition, we guarantee certain liquidity facilities and
certain subsidiaries derivative and other obligations.
 

Note 6 Related Party Transactions

 
In the normal course of business, we engage in various securities trading
and financing activities with many of our subsidiaries (the Related Parties).
Included within non-interest expenses are management fees associated with
affiliate services provided, of $0, $251 million and $423 million in 2007, 2006
and 2005, respectively. Various charges, such as compensation and benefits,
occupancy, administration and computer processing are allocated among the
Related Parties, based on specific identification and other allocation methods.
 
We and our subsidiaries raise money through short- and long-term funding
in capital markets, which is used to fund the operations of certain of our
wholly-owned subsidiaries. We believe amounts arising through related party
transactions, including those allocated expenses referred to above, are
reasonable and approximate the amounts that would have been recorded if we
operated as an unaffiliated entity.
 
Amounts outstanding to and from Related Parties are

Dividends declared to us by our subsidiaries and affiliates were
approximately $3.0 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.4 billion in 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively.
 
Certain covenants contained in various debt agreements may restrict our
ability to withdraw capital from our regulated subsidiaries, which in turn
could limit our ability to pay dividends to shareholders. At November 30,
2007, approximately $10.1 billion of net assets of subsidiaries were restricted
as to the payment of dividends to us.
 

Note 7 Condensed Consolidating
Financial Statement Schedules

 
LBI had approximately $0.8 billion of debt securities outstanding at
November 30, 2007 that were issued in registered public offerings and were
therefore subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act).
Holdings has fully and unconditionally guaranteed these outstanding debt
securities of LBI (and any debt securities of LBI that may be issued in the
future under these registration statements), which, together with the
information presented within this note, allows LBI to avail itself of an
exemption provided by SEC rules from the requirement to file separate LBI
reports under the Exchange Act. For further discussion on the regulatory
requirements of our subsidiaries, see Note 15 to the 2007 Consolidated

a discussion of restrictions on the ability of Holdings to obtain funds
from its subsidiaries by dividend or loan.
 
In 2006, certain wholly-owned subsidiaries of LBI were sold to Holdings
at their then carrying values as part of a corporate restructuring. In
accordance with Statement SFAS 141, Business Combinations,
the accompanying condensed consolidating financial statements report the
results of operations of LBI excluding the results of these entities. As a
result, LBIs net income for the year ended November 30, 2006 does not include
approximately $99 million earned by these entities through September 2006 when
they were transferred. In addition, LBIs opening retained earnings for the
year ended November 30, 2006 was reduced by approximately $229 million,
representing the carrying value of these transferred entities at November 30,
2005. In addition, this sale has been retrospectively applied in the condensed
consolidating financial statements as of and for the year ended November 30,
2005.
 
The following schedules set forth
our condensed consolidating statements of income for the years ended
November 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005; our condensed consolidating balance
sheets at November 30, 2007 and 2006, and our condensed consolidating
statements of cash flows for the years ended November 30, 2007, 2006 and

Brothers Inc. and Other Subsidiaries refers to the combined balances of all
other subsidiaries of Holdings. Eliminations represents the adjustments
necessary to eliminate inter-company transactions and our investments in
subsidiaries.

PART I

 

Wachovia Corporation (formerly named First Union Corporation,
    Wachovia) may from time to time make written or oral
    forward-looking statements, including statements contained in
    Wachovias filings with the Securities and Exchange
    Commission (including this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K
    and the Exhibits hereto), in its reports to stockholders and in
    other Wachovia communications. These statements relate to
    future, not past, events.

 

These forward-looking statements include, among others,
    statements with respect to Wachovias beliefs, plans,
    objectives, goals, guidelines, expectations, financial
    condition, results of operations, future performance and
    business, including without limitation, (i) statements
    relating to the benefits of the merger between Wachovia and
    Golden West Financial Corporation (the Golden West
    Merger) completed on October 1, 2006, including
    future financial and operating results, cost savings, enhanced
    revenues and the accretion or dilution to reported earnings that
    may be realized from the Golden West Merger,
    (ii) statements relating to the benefits of the merger
    between Wachovia and A.G. Edwards, Inc. (the A.G. Edwards
    Merger and together with the Golden West Merger, the
    Mergers), completed on October 1, 2007,
    including future financial and operating results, cost savings,
    enhanced revenues and the accretion or dilution to reported
    earnings that may be realized from the A.G. Edwards Merger,
    (iii) statements regarding Wachovias goals and
    expectations with respect to earnings, earnings per share,
    revenue, expenses and the growth rate in such items, as well as
    other measures of economic performance, including statements
    relating to estimates of credit quality trends, and
    (iv) statements preceded by, followed by or that include
    the words may, could,
    should, would, believe,
    anticipate, estimate,
    expect, intend, plan,
    projects, outlook or similar
    expressions. These forward-looking statements are based upon the
    current beliefs and expectations of Wachovias management
    and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that are
    subject to change based on various factors (many of which are
    beyond Wachovias control). Actual results may differ from
    those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

 

The following factors, among others, could cause
    Wachovias financial performance to differ materially from
    that expressed in any forward-looking statements: (1) the
    risk that the businesses of Wachovia and Golden West in
    connection with the Golden West Merger or the businesses of
    Wachovia and A.G. Edwards in connection with the A.G. Edwards
    Merger will not be integrated successfully or such integration
    may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected;
    (2) expected revenue synergies and cost savings from the
    Mergers may not be fully realized or realized within the
    expected time frame; (3) revenues following the Mergers may
    be lower than expected; (4) deposit attrition, operating
    costs, customer loss and business disruption following the
    Mergers, including, without limitation, difficulties in
    maintaining relationships with employees, may be greater than
    expected; (5) the strength of the United States economy in
    general and the strength of the local economies in which
    Wachovia conducts operations may be different than expected,
    resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit
    quality or a reduced demand for credit, including the resultant
    effect on Wachovias loan portfolio and allowance for loan
    losses; (6) the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary
    and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies
    of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System;
    (7) inflation, interest rate, market and monetary
    fluctuations; (8) adverse conditions in the stock market,
    the public debt market and other capital markets (including
    changes in interest rate conditions) and the impact of such
    conditions on Wachovias capital markets and capital
    management activities, including, without limitation,
    Wachovias mergers and acquisition advisory business,
    equity and debt underwriting activities, private equity
    investment activities, derivative securities activities,
    investment and wealth management advisory businesses, and
    brokerage activities; (9) the timely development of
    competitive new products and services by Wachovia and the
    acceptance of these products and services by new and existing
    customers; (10) the willingness of customers to accept
    third party products marketed by Wachovia; (11) the
    willingness of customers to substitute competitors
    products and services for Wachovias products and services
    and vice versa; (12) the impact of changes in financial
    services laws and regulations (including laws concerning taxes,
    banking, securities and insurance); (13) technological
    changes; (14) changes in consumer spending and saving
    habits; (15) the effect of corporate restructurings,
    acquisitions
    and/or
    dispositions we may undertake from time to time, and the actual
    restructuring and other expenses related thereto, and the
    failure to achieve the expected revenue growth
    and/or
    expense savings from such corporate restructurings, acquisitions
    and/or
    dispositions; (16) the growth and profitability of
    Wachovias noninterest or fee income being less than
    expected; (17) unanticipated regulatory or judicial
    proceedings or rulings; (18) the impact of 





 


changes in accounting principles; (19) adverse changes
    in financial performance
    and/or
    condition of Wachovias borrowers which could impact
    repayment of such borrowers outstanding loans;
    (20) the impact on Wachovias businesses, as well as
    on the risks set forth above, of various domestic or
    international military or terrorist activities or conflicts; and
    (21) Wachovias success at managing the risks involved
    in the foregoing.

 

Wachovia cautions that the foregoing list of important
    factors is not exclusive. Wachovia does not undertake to update
    any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may
    be made from time to time by or on behalf of Wachovia.

    amended. The merger of the former Wachovia Corporation
    (Legacy Wachovia) and First Union Corporation
    (Legacy First Union) was effective September 1,
    2001. Legacy First Union changed its name to Wachovia
    Corporation on the date of the merger. As the surviving
    corporate entity in the merger, information contained in this
    Annual Report on
    Form 10-K,
    unless indicated otherwise, includes information about Legacy
    First Union only. Whenever we use the Wachovia name
    in this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K,
    we mean the new combined company and, before the merger, Legacy
    First Union, unless indicated otherwise.

 

    We provide a wide range of commercial and retail banking and
    trust services through full-service banking offices in Alabama,
    Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida,
    Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Mississippi, Nevada, New
    Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
    Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Our primary
    banking affiliate, Wachovia Bank, National Association
    (WBNA), operates a substantial majority of these
    banking offices, except those in Delaware, which are operated by
    Wachovia Bank of Delaware, National Association, and except
    certain branch offices in Florida, New Jersey and Texas, which
    are operated by Wachovia Mortgage, FSB (formerly named World
    Savings Bank, FSB, Wachovia Mortgage). We also
    provide various other financial services, including mortgage
    banking, investment banking, investment advisory, home equity
    lending, asset-based lending, leasing, insurance, international
    and securities brokerage services, through other subsidiaries.
    Our retail securities brokerage business is conducted through
    Wachovia Securities, LLC, and operates in 49 states.

 

    Our principal executive offices are located at One Wachovia
    Center, 301 South College Street, Charlotte, North Carolina
    28288-0013
    (telephone number
    (704) 374-6565).

 

    Since the 1985 Supreme Court decision allowing interstate
    banking expansion, we have concentrated our efforts on building
    a large, diversified financial services organization. Since
    November 1985, we have completed over 100 banking-related
    acquisitions.

 

    Our business focus is on generating improved core earnings
    growth from our four key businesses, including Capital
    Management, the General Bank, Wealth Management, and the
    Corporate and Investment Bank. We will continue to evaluate our
    operations and organizational structures to ensure they are
    closely aligned with our goal of maximizing performance in our
    core business lines. When consistent with our overall business
    strategy, we may consider the disposition of certain assets,
    branches, subsidiaries or lines of business. We routinely
    explore acquisition opportunities, particularly in areas that
    would complement our core business lines, and frequently conduct
    due diligence activities in connection with possible
    acquisitions. As a result, acquisition discussions and, in some
    cases, negotiations frequently take place and future
    acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities can be
    expected.

COMPETITION

 

    Our subsidiaries face substantial competition in their
    operations from domestic and international banking and
    non-banking institutions, including savings and loan
    associations, credit unions, money market funds and other
    investment vehicles, mutual fund advisory companies, brokerage
    firms, insurance companies, hedge funds, private equity firms,
    leasing companies, credit card issuers, mortgage banking
    companies, investment banking companies, finance companies and
    other types of financial services providers, including
    Internet-only financial service providers.

 

REGULATION AND
    SUPERVISION

 

The following discussion sets forth some of the material
    elements of the regulatory framework applicable to financial
    holding companies and bank holding companies and their
    subsidiaries and provides some specific information relevant to
    us. The regulatory framework is intended primarily for the
    protection of depositors and the Bank Insurance Fund and not for
    the protection of security holders and creditors. To the extent
    that the following information describes statutory and
    regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by
    reference to the particular statutory and regulatory
    provisions.

 

    The current regulatory environment for financial institutions
    includes substantial enforcement activity by the federal banking
    agencies, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities
    and Exchange Commission and other state and federal law
    enforcement agencies, reflecting an increase in activity over
    prior years. This environment entails significant potential
    increases in compliance requirements and associated costs.

 

Bank
    Holding Company Activities

 

General

 

    As a financial holding company and a bank holding company,
    Wachovia is regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act of
    1956, as well as other federal and state laws governing the
    banking business. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
    System (the Federal Reserve Board) is the primary
    regulator of Wachovia, and supervises our activities on a
    continual basis. Our subsidiaries are also subject to regulation
    and supervision by various regulatory authorities, including the
    Federal Reserve Board, the Comptroller of the Currency (the
    Comptroller), the Office of Thrift Supervision (the
    OTS) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
    (the FDIC).

 

    The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999,
    which amended the Bank Holding Company Act,

 







 
      


    allows bank holding companies that qualify as financial
    holding companies to engage in a broad range of financial
    and related activities;


 

 
      


    allows insurers and other financial services companies to
    acquire banks;







 

 







 
      


    removes various restrictions that applied to bank holding
    company ownership of securities firms and mutual fund advisory
    companies; and


 

 
      


    establishes the overall regulatory structure applicable to bank
    holding companies that also engage in insurance and securities
    operations.



 

    The Federal Reserve Board notified us that, effective
    March 13, 2000, we are authorized to operate as a financial
    holding company and therefore are eligible to engage in, or
    acquire companies engaged in, the broader range of activities
    that are permitted by the Modernization Act. These activities
    include those that are determined to be financial in
    nature, including insurance underwriting, securities
    underwriting and dealing, and making merchant banking
    investments in commercial and financial companies. If any of our
    banking subsidiaries ceases to be well capitalized
    or well managed under applicable regulatory
    standards, the Federal Reserve Board may, among other things,
    place limitations on our ability to conduct these broader
    financial activities or, if the deficiencies persist, require us
    to divest the banking subsidiary. In addition, if any of our
    banking subsidiaries receives a rating of less than satisfactory
    under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA),
    we would be prohibited from engaging in any additional
    activities other than those permissible for bank holding
    companies that are not financial holding companies. Our banking
    subsidiaries currently meet these capital, management and CRA
    requirements.

 

Interstate
    Banking

 

    The Reigle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act
    of 1994 (the IBBEA) authorized interstate
    acquisitions of banks and bank holding companies without
    geographic limitation. Under IBBEA a bank holding company cannot
    make an interstate acquisition of a bank if, as a result, it
    would control more than 10% of the total United States insured
    depository deposits and more than 30% or the applicable state
    law limit of deposits in that state.

 

Banking
    Acquisitions

 

    As a bank holding company, we are required to obtain prior
    Federal Reserve Board approval before acquiring more than 5% of
    the voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank
    holding company, bank or savings association. In determining
    whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank
    regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the
    acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be
    received from the acquisition, the projected capital ratios and
    levels on a post-acquisition basis, and the acquiring
    institutions record of addressing the credit needs of the
    communities it serves, including the needs of low and moderate
    income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound
    operation of the bank, under the CRA.

 

Subsidiary
    Dividends

 

    Wachovia is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
    banking and other subsidiaries. A major portion of our revenues
    results from amounts paid as dividends to us by our bank
    subsidiaries. The Comptrollers prior approval is required
    if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any
    calendar year will exceed the sum of that banks net
    profits for that year and its retained net profits for the
    preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to
    surplus. Federal law also prohibits national banks from paying
    dividends that would be greater than the banks undivided
    profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the
    banks allowance for loan losses. In addition, our federal
    savings banks must file a notice with the OTS at least
    30 days prior to paying a dividend to their parent company.

 

    Under the foregoing dividend restrictions and certain
    restrictions applicable to certain of our non-banking
    subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2007, our subsidiaries,
    without obtaining affirmative governmental approvals, could pay
    aggregate dividends of $14.3 billion to us during 2008.
    This amount is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be
    available in future periods. In 2007, our subsidiaries paid
    $2.9 billion in cash dividends to us.

 

    In addition, we and our banking subsidiaries are subject to
    various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to
    the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain
    adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate
    federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under
    certain circumstances





 


    relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding
    company that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or
    unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. The
    appropriate federal regulatory authorities have indicated that
    paying dividends that deplete a banks capital base to an
    inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice
    and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends
    only out of current operating earnings.

 

Source of
    Strength

 

    Under Federal Reserve Board policy, we are expected to act as a
    source of financial strength to each of our subsidiary banks and
    to commit resources to support each of those subsidiaries. This
    support may be required at times when, absent that Federal
    Reserve Board policy, we may not find ourselves able to provide
    it. Capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its
    subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits
    and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In
    the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy, any
    commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank
    regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank
    will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a
    priority of payment.

 

    Federal law also authorizes the Comptroller to order an
    assessment of Wachovia if the capital of one of our national
    bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If we failed to pay
    the assessment within three months, the Comptroller could order
    the sale of our stock in the national bank to cover the
    deficiency.

 

Capital
    Requirements

 

    Federal banking regulators have adopted risk-based capital and
    leverage guidelines that require that our capital-to-assets
    ratios meet certain minimum standards. Under the risk-based
    capital requirements for bank holding companies, the minimum
    requirement for the ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets
    (including certain off-balance-sheet activities, such as standby
    letters of credit) is 8%. At least half of the total capital (as
    defined below) is to be composed of common stockholders
    equity, retained earnings, qualifying perpetual preferred stock
    (in a limited amount in the case of cumulative preferred stock)
    and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated
    subsidiaries, less goodwill and certain intangibles
    (tier 1 capital). The remainder of total
    capital may consist of mandatory convertible debt securities and
    a limited amount of subordinated debt, qualifying preferred
    stock and loan loss allowance (tier 2 capital,
    and together with tier 1 capital, total
    capital). At December 31, 2007, our tier 1
    capital and total capital ratios were 7.35% and 11.82%,
    respectively.

 

    In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has established minimum
    leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. These
    requirements provide for a minimum leverage ratio of tier 1
    capital to adjusted average quarterly assets less certain
    amounts (leverage ratio) equal to 3% for bank
    holding companies that meet certain specified criteria,
    including having the highest regulatory rating. All other bank
    holding companies will generally be required to maintain a
    leverage ratio of at least 4%. Our leverage ratio at
    December 31, 2007, was 6.09%. The guidelines also provide
    that bank holding companies experiencing internal growth or
    making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital
    positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels
    without significant reliance on intangible assets. Furthermore,
    the guidelines indicate that the Federal Reserve Board will
    continue to consider a tangible tier 1 leverage
    ratio (deducting all intangibles) in evaluating proposals
    for expansion or to engage in new activity. The Federal Reserve
    Board has not advised us of any specific minimum leverage ratio
    or tier 1 leverage ratio applicable to us.

 

    Each of our subsidiary banks is subject to similar capital
    requirements adopted by the Comptroller, the OTS or other
    applicable regulatory agency. Neither the Comptroller, the OTS
    nor such other applicable regulatory agency has advised any of
    our subsidiary banks of any specific minimum leverage ratios
    applicable to it. The capital ratios of our bank subsidiaries
    are set forth in Table 19 on page 64 in the Annual Report
    and incorporated herein by reference.

 

    The risk-based capital requirements identify concentrations of
    credit risk and certain risks arising from non-traditional
    activities, and the management of those risks, as important
    factors to consider in assessing an institutions overall
    capital adequacy. Other factors taken into consideration by
    federal regulators include: interest rate exposure; liquidity,
    funding and market risk; the quality and level of earnings; the
    quality of loans and investments; the effectiveness of loan and
    investment policies; and managements overall ability to





 


    monitor and control financial and operational risks, including
    the risks presented by concentrations of credit and
    non-traditional activities.

 

    Effective April 1, 2002, Federal Reserve Board rules govern
    the regulatory capital treatment of merchant banking investments
    and certain other equity investments, including investments made
    by our principal investing group, in non-financial companies
    held by bank holding companies. The rules generally impose a
    capital charge that increases incrementally as the value of the
    banking organizations equity investments increase. An 8%
    tier 1 capital deduction would apply on covered investments
    that in total represent up to 15% of an organizations
    tier 1 capital. For covered investments that total more
    than 25% of the organizations tier 1 capital, a
    capital deduction of 25% would be imposed. Equity investments
    made through small business investment companies in an amount up
    to 15% of the banking organizations tier 1 capital
    are exempt from the new charges, but the full amount of the
    equity investments are still included when calculating the
    aggregate value of the banking organizations non-financial
    equity investments.

 

    Changes to the risk-based capital regime are frequently proposed
    or implemented. The minimum risk-based capital requirements
    adopted by the federal banking agencies follow the Capital
    Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Please see
    Regulatory Matters in the Annual Report,
    incorporated herein by reference, for additional information on
    the Basel Committee.

 

Bank
    Activities

 

General

 

    WBNA and our other national bank subsidiaries are subject to the
    provisions of the National Bank Act, are under the supervision
    of, and subject to periodic examination by, the Comptroller, and
    are subject to the rules and regulations of the Comptroller, the
    Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC. Wachovia Mortgage and our
    other federal savings bank subsidiaries are under the
    supervision of, and subject to periodic examination by, the OTS,
    and are subject to the rules and regulations of the OTS, the
    Federal Reserve Board, and the FDIC. WBNAs operations in
    other countries are also subject to various restrictions imposed
    by the laws of those countries. In addition, all of our banks
    have FDIC insurance and are subject to the Federal Deposit
    Insurance Act (the FDIA).

 

Prompt
    Corrective Action

 

    The FDIA, among other things, requires the federal banking
    agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect
    of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital
    requirements. The FDIA establishes five tiers for FDIC-insured
    banks: (i) well capitalized if it has a total
    capital ratio of 10% or greater, a tier 1 capital ratio of
    6% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater and is not
    subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory
    authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any
    capital measure; (ii) adequately capitalized if
    it has a total capital ratio of 8% or greater, a tier 1
    capital ratio of 4% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4% or
    greater (3% in certain circumstances) and is not well
    capitalized; (iii) undercapitalized if it
    has a total capital ratio of less than 8%, a tier 1 capital
    ratio of less than 4% or a leverage ratio of less than 4% (3% in
    certain circumstances); (iv) significantly
    undercapitalized if it has a total capital ratio of less
    than 6%, a tier 1 capital ratio of less than 3% or a
    leverage ratio of less than 3%; and (v) critically
    undercapitalized if its tangible equity is equal to or
    less than 2% of average quarterly tangible assets. An
    institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital
    category that is lower than is indicated by its capital ratios
    if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or
    if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect
    to certain matters. As of December 31, 2007, all of our
    deposit-taking subsidiary banks had capital levels that qualify
    them as being well capitalized under those
    regulations.

 

    Undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to growth
    limitations, the requirement to submit a capital restoration
    plan, and a variety of other restrictions the severity of which
    are keyed to the banks capital tier and other factors.
    Ultimately, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject
    to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.





 


Cross
    Default

 

    Each of our banks can be held liable for any loss incurred, or
    reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the
    default of any other of our banks, and for any assistance
    provided by the FDIC to any of our banks that is in danger of
    default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company.
    Default means generally the appointment of a
    conservator or receiver. In danger of default means
    generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a
    default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory
    assistance. An FDIC cross-guarantee claim against a bank is
    generally superior in right of payment to claims of the holding
    company and its affiliates against such depository institution.

 

    If the FDIC is appointed the conservator or receiver of an
    insured depository institution, upon its insolvency or in
    certain other events, the FDIC has the power: (i) to
    transfer any of the depository institutions assets and
    liabilities to a new obligor without the approval of the
    depository institutions creditors; (ii) to enforce
    the terms of the depository institutions contracts
    pursuant to their terms; or (iii) to repudiate or disaffirm
    any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a
    party, the performance of which is determined by the FDIC to be
    burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is
    determined by the FDIC to promote the orderly administration of
    the depository institution.

 

Deposit
    Insurance

 

    The FDIC assessment rate on our subsidiary bank deposits
    currently is zero, but may change in the future. The FDIC may
    increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a
    semiannual basis. An increase in the BIF assessment rate could
    have a material adverse effect on our earnings, depending on the
    amount of the increase. The FDIC is authorized to terminate a
    depository banks deposit insurance upon a finding by the
    FDIC that the banks financial condition is unsafe or
    unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound
    practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order
    or condition enacted or imposed by the banks regulatory
    agency. The termination of deposit insurance for one or more of
    our subsidiary depository banks could have a material adverse
    effect on our earnings, depending on the collective size of the
    particular institutions involved. In addition, if the ratio of
    insured deposits to money in the BIF drops below specified
    levels, the FDIC would be required to impose premiums on all
    banks insured by the BIF.

 

Borrowings

 

    There are also various legal restrictions on the extent to which
    Wachovia and our non-bank subsidiaries can transfer funds to, or
    borrow or otherwise obtain credit from, our banking
    subsidiaries. In general, these restrictions require that any
    such extensions of credit must be secured by designated amounts
    of specified collateral and are limited, as to any one of us or
    those non-bank subsidiaries, to 10% of the lending banks
    capital stock and surplus, and as to us and all non-bank
    subsidiaries in the aggregate, to 20% of such lending
    banks capital stock and surplus. A banks
    transactions with its non-bank affiliates are also generally
    required to be on arms length terms.

 

Depositor
    Preference

 

    Under federal law, deposits and certain claims for
    administrative expenses and employee compensation against an
    insured depository institution would be afforded a priority over
    other general unsecured claims against such an institution,
    including federal funds and letters of credit, in the
    liquidation or other resolution of such an
    institution by any receiver. As a result, whether or not the
    FDIC ever sought to repudiate any obligations held by public
    noteholders of any subsidiary of Wachovia that is an insured
    depository institution, the public noteholders would be treated
    differently from, and could receive, if anything, substantially
    less than, the depositors of the depository institution.

 

Other
    Regulation

 

Non-Bank
    Activities

 

    Our bank and certain nonbank subsidiaries are subject to direct
    supervision and regulation by various other federal, state and
    foreign authorities (many of which will be considered
    functional regulators under the Modernization Act).
    We also conduct securities underwriting, dealing and brokerage
    activities primarily





 


    through Wachovia Securities, LLC and Wachovia Capital Markets,
    LLC, which are principally regulated by the SEC and the
    Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The
    operations of our mutual funds also are subject to regulation by
    the SEC. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by
    applicable state insurance regulatory agencies. The types of
    activities in which the foreign branches of WBNA and our
    international subsidiaries may engage are subject to various
    restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Board. Those foreign
    branches and international subsidiaries also are subject to the
    laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they
    operate.

 

    The Wachovia entities that are broker-dealers registered with
    the SEC are subject to, among other things, net capital rules
    designed to measure the general financial condition and
    liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under these rules, these entities
    are required to maintain the minimum net capital deemed
    necessary to meet broker-dealers continuing commitments to
    customers and others and required to keep a substantial portion
    of their assets in relatively liquid form. Broker-dealers are
    also subject to other regulations covering their business
    operations, including sales and trading practices, public
    offerings, publication of research reports, use and safekeeping
    of client funds and securities, capital structure,
    record-keeping and the conduct of directors, officers and
    employees. Broker-dealers are also subject to regulation by
    state securities regulators in applicable states. Violations of
    the regulations governing the actions of a broker-dealer can
    result in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the
    imposition of censures or fines, the issuance of cease and
    desist orders and the suspension or expulsion from the
    securities business of a firm, its officers or its employees.

 

    Wachovia entities engaging in our investment management
    activities are registered as investment advisers with the SEC,
    and in certain states, some employees are registered as
    investment adviser representatives. Recent legislative and
    regulatory scrutiny in the mutual fund industry has increased.
    This scrutiny has resulted in the adoption of new rules and a
    number of legislative and regulatory proposals, including SEC
    rules designed to strengthen existing prohibitions relating to
    late trading and enhance required disclosure and supervision of
    market timing policies and pricing and mutual fund sales
    practices.

 

    Our subsidiaries acting as consumer lenders also are subject to
    regulation under various federal laws, including the
    Truth-in-Lending,
    the Equal Credit Opportunity, the Fair Credit Reporting, the
    Fair Debt Collection Practice and the Electronic Funds Transfer
    Acts, as well as various state laws. These statutes impose
    requirements on the making, enforcement and collection of
    consumer loans and on the types of disclosures that need to be
    made in connection with such loans.

 

International
    Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of
    2001

 

    The USA Patriot Act of 2001 contains the International Money
    Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001
    (the IMLAFA). The IMLAFA substantially broadens
    existing anti-money laundering legislation and the
    extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States, imposes new
    compliance and due diligence obligations, creates new crimes and
    penalties, compels the production of documents located both
    inside and outside the United States, including those of foreign
    institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the
    United States, and clarifies the safe harbor from civil
    liability to customers. The U.S. Treasury Department has
    issued a number of regulations implementing the USA Patriot Act
    that apply certain of its requirements to financial institutions
    such as our banking and broker-dealer subsidiaries. The
    regulations impose new obligations on financial institutions to
    maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to
    detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist
    financing. The increased obligations of financial institutions,
    including Wachovia, to identify their customers, watch for and
    report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for
    information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement
    agencies, and share information with other financial
    institutions, requires the implementation and maintenance of
    internal procedures, practices and controls which have
    increased, and may continue to increase, our costs and may
    subject us to liability.

 

    Pursuant to the IMLAFA, Wachovia established anti-money
    laundering compliance and due diligence programs which include,
    among other things, the designation of a compliance officer,
    employee training programs, and an independent audit function to
    review and test the program.

 

    As noted above, enforcement and compliance-related activity by
    government agencies has increased. Money laundering and
    anti-terrorism compliance are among the areas receiving a high
    level of focus in the present environment.





 


Privacy

 

    Under the Modernization Act, federal banking regulators adopted
    rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial
    institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers
    to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of
    privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow
    consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information
    to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the
    Modernization Act affect how consumer information is transmitted
    through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to
    outside vendors.

 

Future
    Legislation

 

    Changes to the laws and regulations (including changes in
    interpretation or enforcement) in the states and countries where
    we and our subsidiaries do business can affect the operating
    environment of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries in
    substantial and unpredictable ways. From time to time, various
    legislative and regulatory proposals are introduced. These
    proposals, if codified, may change banking statutes and
    regulations and our operating environment in substantial and
    unpredictable ways. If codified, these proposals could increase
    or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand
    permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among
    banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial
    institutions. We cannot accurately predict whether those changes
    in laws and regulations will occur, and, if those changes occur,
    the ultimate effect they would have upon our financial condition
    or results of operations. It is likely, however, that the
    current high level of enforcement and compliance-related
    activities of federal and state authorities will continue and
    potentially increase.

ITEM 1A.          


RISK
    FACTORS.



 

    An investment in Wachovias securities may involve risks
    due to the nature of the businesses we engage in and activities
    related to those businesses. The following are the most
    significant risks associated with those businesses or activities:

 

Business risk. Wachovias business model is
    based on a diversified mix of businesses that provide a broad
    range of financial products and services, delivered through
    multiple distribution channels. Wachovias diversified
    businesses are subject to a wide range of competition, ranging
    from smaller community banking institutions, financial advisors
    and investment advisors to large, diversified, multi-national
    financial services providers. Risks associated with our business
    model include:

 







 
      


    the timely development of competitive new products and services
    by Wachovia and the acceptance of these products and services by
    new and existing customers;


 

 
      


    the willingness of customers to accept third party products
    marketed by Wachovia;


 

 
      


    the willingness of customers to substitute competitors
    products and services for Wachovias products and services
    and vice versa;


 

 
      


    the impact of changes in financial services laws and
    regulations (including laws concerning taxes, banking,
    securities and insurance);


 

 
      


    technological changes; and


 

 
      


    changes in consumer spending and saving habits.



 

Credit risk. Wachovia is one of the nations
    largest lenders, and the credit quality of our portfolio can
    have a significant impact on our earnings. Credit risk is the
    risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers





 


    ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon
    terms. Risks associated with our credit quality include:

 







 
      


    the strength of the United States economy in general and the
    strength of the local economies in which Wachovia conducts
    operations may be different than expected resulting in, among
    other things, a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced
    demand for credit, including the resultant effect on
    Wachovias loan portfolio and allowance for loan
    losses; and


 

 
      


    adverse changes in the financial performance
    and/or
    condition of Wachovias borrowers which could impact
    repayment of such borrowers outstanding loans.



 

Market risk. Wachovias businesses are subject
    to market risk. The components of market risk are interest rate
    risk inherent in our balance sheet, price risk in our principal
    investing portfolio and market value risk in our trading
    portfolios. Risks associated with managing market risk include:

 







 
      


    the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary and fiscal
    policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the
    Federal Reserve Board;


 

 
      


    inflation, interest rate, market and monetary
    fluctuations; and


 

 
      


    adverse conditions in the stock market, the public debt market
    and other capital markets (including changes in interest rate
    conditions) and the impact of such conditions on Wachovias
    capital markets and capital management activities, including,
    without limitation, Wachovias mergers and acquisition
    advisory business, equity and debt underwriting activities,
    private equity investment activities, derivative securities
    activities, investment and wealth management advisory
    businesses, and brokerage activities.



 

Operational risk. Operational risk is the risk of
    loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and
    systems or from external events. Risks associated with
    operational risk include:

 







 
      


    unanticipated regulatory or judicial proceedings or rulings;


 

 
      


    matters impacting our business or ethical reputation;


 

 
      


    the impact of changes in accounting principles;


 

 
      


    the impact on Wachovias businesses of various domestic or
    international military or terrorist activities or
    conflicts; and


 

 
      


    Wachovias success at managing all of these risks.



 

Acquisitions and divestitures. When consistent with
    our overall business strategy, we may consider disposing of
    certain assets, branches, subsidiaries or lines of business. We
    continue to routinely explore acquisition opportunities in areas
    that would complement our core businesses, and frequently
    conduct due diligence activities in connection with possible
    acquisitions. As a result, acquisition discussions and, in some
    cases, negotiations frequently take place and future
    acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities could
    occur. In the event Wachovia engages in acquisitions or
    divestitures, there are risks involved. Risks associated with
    acquisitions and divestitures include:

 







 
      


    the risk that the businesses proposed to be acquired or divested
    will not be integrated successfully or such integration may be
    more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected;


 

 
      


    the risk that expected revenue synergies and cost savings from
    the businesses proposed to be acquired may not be fully realized
    or realized within the expected time frames;


 

 
      


    the risk that revenues following the proposed acquisition may be
    lower than expected; and


 

 
      


    the risk that deposit attrition, operating costs, customer loss
    and business disruption following the proposed acquisition,
    including, without limitation, difficulties in maintaining
    relationships with employees, may be greater than expected.

ITEM 2.          


PROPERTIES.



 

    As of December 31, 2007, we and our subsidiaries owned
    2,006 locations and leased 5,071 locations in 50 states,
    Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and 36 foreign countries from
    which our business is conducted, including a multi-building
    office complex in Charlotte, North Carolina, which serves as
    Wachovias administrative headquarters, as well as the
    headquarters of WBNA, Wachovia Mortgage Corporation, Wachovia
    Capital Markets, LLC, Wachovia Mortgage and most of our
    non-banking subsidiaries. That multi-office complex is used as
    administrative headquarters for our General Bank, Corporate and
    Investment Bank, Capital Management and the Parent segments as
    identified in our Annual Report. Wachovias Wealth
    Management segment, as identified in our Annual Report, has its
    principal administrative offices in a multi-office complex in
    Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

 

    Some of our non-banking subsidiaries have principal
    administrative offices in other cities in the United States. The
    principal administrative offices of our retail securities
    brokerage operations are in St. Louis, Missouri. The
    principal administrative offices of our mutual fund operations
    are in Boston, Massachusetts. Certain of our institutional
    securities operations are conducted in offices in New York, New
    York. Certain of the administrative functions for Wachovia
    Mortgage are conducted in offices in Oakland, California. The
    vast majority of our leased and owned properties are used for
    our branch banking operations and retail securities brokerage
    offices. Additional information relating to our lease
    commitments is set forth in Note 20 on page 128 in the
    Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference.


 







ITEM 3.          


LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS.



 

    Wachovia and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in a
    number of judicial, regulatory and arbitration proceedings
    concerning matters arising from the conduct of our business
    activities. These proceedings include actions brought against
    Wachovia
    and/or its
    subsidiaries with respect to transactions in which Wachovia
    and/or our
    subsidiaries acted as banker, lender, underwriter, financial
    advisor or broker or in activities related thereto. In addition,
    Wachovia and its subsidiaries may be requested to provide
    information or otherwise cooperate with governmental authorities
    in the conduct of investigations of other persons or industry
    groups. It is Wachovias policy to cooperate in all
    regulatory inquiries and investigations.

 

    Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome,
    Wachovia
    and/or our
    subsidiaries have generally denied, or believe we have a
    meritorious defense and will deny, liability in all significant
    litigation pending against us, including the matters described
    below, and we intend to defend vigorously each such case.
    Reserves are established for legal claims when payments
    associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be
    reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims
    may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved
    for those claims.

 

In the Matter of KPMG LLP Certain Auditor Independence
    Issues. The SEC has requested Wachovia to produce
    certain information concerning any agreements or understandings
    by which Wachovia referred clients to KPMG LLP during the period
    January 1, 1997 to November 2003 in connection with an
    inquiry regarding the independence of KPMG LLP as
    Wachovias outside auditors during such period. Wachovia is
    continuing to cooperate with the SEC in its inquiry, which is
    being conducted pursuant to a formal order of investigation
    entered by the SEC on October 21, 2003. Wachovia believes
    the SECs inquiry relates to certain tax services offered
    to Wachovia customers by KPMG LLP during the period from 1997 to
    early 2002, and whether these activities might have caused KPMG
    LLP not to be independent from Wachovia, as defined
    by applicable accounting and SEC regulations requiring auditors
    of an SEC-reporting company to be independent of the company.
    Wachovia
    and/or KPMG
    LLP received fees in connection with a small number of personal
    financial consulting transactions related to these services.
    KPMG LLP has confirmed to Wachovia that during all periods
    covered by the SECs inquiry, including the present, KPMG
    LLP was and is independent from Wachovia under
    applicable accounting and SEC regulations.

 

Financial Advisor Wage/Hour Class Action
    Litigation. Wachovia Securities, LLC, Wachovias
    retail securities brokerage subsidiary, is a defendant in
    multiple state and nationwide putative class actions alleging
    unpaid overtime wages and improper wage deductions for financial
    advisors. In December 2006 and January 2007, related cases
    pending in U.S. District courts in several states were
    consolidated for case administrative purposes in the
    U.S. District Court for the Central District of California
    pursuant to two orders of the Multi-District Litigation Panel.
    There is an additional case alleging a statewide class under
    California law, which is





 


    currently pending in Superior Court in Los Angeles county,
    California. Wachovia believes that it has meritorious defenses
    to the claims asserted in these lawsuits, which are part of an
    industry trend of related wage/hour class action litigation, and
    intends to defend vigorously the cases.

 

Adelphia Litigation. Certain Wachovia affiliates are
    defendants in an adversary proceeding previously pending in the
    United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
    York related to the bankruptcy of Adelphia Communications
    Corporation (Adelphia). In February 2006, an order
    was entered moving the case to the United States District Court
    for the Southern District of New York. The Official Committee of
    Unsecured Creditors in Adelphias bankruptcy case has filed
    claims on behalf of Adelphia against over 300 financial services
    companies, including the Wachovia affiliates. The complaint
    asserts claims against the defendants under state law,
    bankruptcy law and the Bank Holding Company Act and seeks
    equitable relief and an unspecified amount of compensatory and
    punitive damages. The Official Committee of Equity Security
    Holders has sought leave to intervene in that complaint and
    sought leave to bring additional claims against certain of the
    financial services companies, including the Wachovia affiliates,
    including additional federal and state claims. On
    August 30, 2005, the bankruptcy court granted the
    creditors committee and the equity holders committee
    standing to proceed with their claims. On June 11, 2007,
    the court granted in part and denied in part the motions to
    dismiss filed by Wachovia and other defendants. On July 11,
    2007, Wachovia and other defendants requested leave to appeal
    the partial denial of the motions to dismiss. On
    January 17, 2008, the district court affirmed the decision
    of the bankruptcy court on the motion to dismiss with the
    exception that it dismissed one additional claim.

 

    In addition, certain affiliates of Wachovia, together with
    numerous other financial services companies, have been named in
    several private civil actions by investors in Adelphia debt
    and/or
    equity securities, alleging among other claims, misstatements in
    connection with Adelphia securities offerings between 1997 and
    2001. Wachovia affiliates acted as an underwriter in certain of
    those securities offerings, as agent
    and/or
    lender for certain Adelphia credit facilities, and as a provider
    of Adelphias treasury/cash management services. These
    complaints, which seek unspecified damages, have been
    consolidated in the United States District Court for the
    Southern District of New York. In separate orders entered in May
    and July 2005, the District Court dismissed a number of the
    securities law claims asserted against Wachovia, leaving some
    securities law claims pending. Wachovia still has a pending
    motion to dismiss with respect to these claims. On June 15,
    2006, the District Court signed the preliminary order with
    respect to a proposed settlement of the securities class action
    pending against Wachovia and the other financial services
    companies. At a fairness hearing on the settlement on
    November 10, 2006, the District Court approved the
    settlement. Wachovias share of the settlement,
    $1.173 million, was paid in November 2006. The other
    private civil actions have not been settled.

 

Le-Natures, Inc. Wachovia Bank, N.A. is the
    administrative agent on a $285 million credit facility
    extended to Le-Natures, Inc. in September 2006, of which
    approximately $270 million was syndicated to other lenders
    by Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC as Lead Arranger and Sole
    Bookrunner. Le-Natures was the subject of a Chapter 7
    bankruptcy petition which was converted to a Chapter 11
    bankruptcy petition in November 2006 in U.S. Bankruptcy
    Court in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania following a report by a
    court-appointed custodian in a proceeding in Delaware that
    revealed fraud and significant accounting irregularities on the
    part of Le-Natures management, including maintenance of a
    dual set of financial records. On March 14, 2007, Wachovia
    filed an action against several hedge funds in Superior Court
    for the State of North Carolina entitled Wachovia Bank,
    National Association and Wachovia Capital Markets LLC v.
    Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund I, Ltd. et al.,
    alleging that the hedge fund defendants had acquired a
    significant quantity of the outstanding debt with full knowledge
    of the Le Natures fraud and with the intention of pursuing
    alleged fraud and other tort claims against Wachovia purportedly
    related to its role in the Le-Natures credit facility. The
    assertion of such claims would constitute a violation of North
    Carolinas legal and public policy prohibitions on
    champerty and maintenance. A preliminary injunction has been
    entered by the Court that, among other things, prohibits
    defendants from asserting any such claims in any other forum,
    but allowing these defendants to bring any claims they believe
    they possess against Wachovia as compulsory counterclaims in the
    North Carolina action. On September 18, 2007, these
    defendants filed an action in the U.S. District Court for
    the Southern District of New York against Wachovia Capital
    Markets LLC, a third party and two members of Le-Natures
    management asserting claims arising under federal RICO laws.
    Three original purchasers of the debt also joined the action and
    asserted various tort claims, including fraud. Wachovia has
    filed a motion in the North Carolina court seeking to have these
    defendants held in contempt for violating the preliminary





 


    injunction and is seeking dismissal of the New York action.
    Wachovia, which itself was victimized by the Le-Natures
    fraud, will pursue its rights against Le-Natures and in
    this litigation vigorously.

 

Interchange Litigation. Wachovia Bank, N.A. and
    Wachovia are named as defendants in seven putative class actions
    filed on behalf of a plaintiff class of merchants with regard to
    the interchange fees associated with Visa and Mastercard payment
    card transactions. These actions have been consolidated with
    more than 40 other actions, which did not name Wachovia as a
    defendant, in the United Stated District Court for the Eastern
    District of New York. Visa, Mastercard and several banks and
    bank holding companies are named as defendants in various of
    these actions which were consolidated before the Court pursuant
    to orders of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. The
    amended and consolidated complaint asserts claims against
    defendants based on alleged violations of federal and state
    antitrust laws and seeks damages, as well as injunctive relief.
    Plaintiff merchants allege that Visa, Mastercard and their
    member banks unlawfully collude to set interchange fees.
    Plaintiffs also allege that enforcement of certain Visa and
    MasterCard rules and alleged tying and bundling of services
    offered to merchants are anticompetitive. The payment card
    association defendants and banking defendants are aggressively
    defending the consolidated action. Wachovia, along with other
    members of Visa, is a party to Loss and Judgment Sharing
    Agreements, which provide that Wachovia, along with other member
    banks of Visa, will share, based on a formula, in any losses in
    connection with certain litigation specified in the Agreements,
    including the Interchange Litigation. On November 7, 2007,
    Visa announced that it had reached a settlement with American
    Express in connection with certain litigation which is covered
    by Wachovias obligations as a Visa member bank and by the
    Loss Sharing Agreement.

 

Payment Processing Center. On February 17,
    2006, the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern
    District of Pennsylvania filed a civil fraud complaint against a
    former Wachovia Bank, N.A. customer, Payment Processing Center
    (PPC). PPC was a third party payment processor for
    telemarketing and catalogue companies. On April 12, 2007, a
    civil class action, Faloney et al. v. Wachovia, was
    filed against Wachovia in the U.S. District Court for the
    Eastern District of Pennsylvania by a putative class of
    consumers who made purchases through telemarketer customers of
    PPC. The suit alleges that between April 1, 2005 and
    February 21, 2006, Wachovia conspired with PPC to
    facilitate PPCs purported violation of RICO. The Office of
    the Comptroller of the Currency is conducting a formal
    investigation of Wachovias handling of the PPC account
    relationship and of five other customers engaged in similar
    businesses. Wachovia is vigorously defending the civil lawsuit
    and is cooperating with government officials in the
    investigations of PPC and Wachovias handling of the PPC
    customer relationship.

 

Municipal Derivatives Bid Practices
    Investigation. The Department of Justice
    (DOJ) and the SEC, beginning in November 2006, have
    been requesting information from a number of financial
    institutions, including Wachovia Bank, N.A.s municipal
    derivatives group, generally with regard to competitive bid
    practices in the municipal derivative markets. In connection
    with these inquiries, Wachovia Bank, N.A. has received subpoenas
    from both the DOJ and SEC seeking documents and information. The
    DOJ and the SEC have advised Wachovia Bank, N.A. that they
    believe certain of its employees engaged in improper conduct in
    conjunction with certain competitively bid transactions and, in
    November 2007, the DOJ notified two Wachovia Bank, N.A.
    employees, both of whom are on administrative leave, that they
    are regarded as targets of the DOJs investigation.
    Wachovia Bank, N.A. has been cooperating and continues to fully
    cooperate with the government investigations.

 

Other Regulatory Matters. Governmental and
    self-regulatory authorities have instituted numerous ongoing
    investigations of various practices in the securities and mutual
    fund industries, including those discussed in Wachovias
    previous filings with the SEC and those relating to sales
    practices and record retention. The investigations cover
    advisory companies to mutual funds, broker-dealers, hedge funds
    and others. Wachovia has received subpoenas and other requests
    for documents and testimony relating to the investigations, is
    endeavoring to comply with those requests, is cooperating with
    the investigations, and where appropriate, is engaging in
    discussions to resolve the investigations. Wachovia is
    continuing its own internal review of policies, practices,
    procedures and personnel, and is taking remedial action where
    appropriate.

 

Outlook. Based on information currently available,
    advice of counsel, available insurance coverage and established
    reserves, Wachovia believes that the eventual outcome of the
    actions against Wachovia
    and/or its
    subsidiaries, including the matters described above, will not,
    individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect
    on Wachovias consolidated financial position or results of
    operations. However, in the event of





 


    unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate
    resolution of those matters, if unfavorable, may be material to
    Wachovias results of operations for any particular period.

    Our common stock is listed on the NYSE. Table 6 on page 53
    in the Annual Report sets forth information relating to the
    quarterly prices of, and quarterly dividends paid on, the common
    stock for the two-year period ended December 31, 2007, and
    incorporated herein by reference. Prices shown represent the
    high, low and quarter-end sale prices of the common stock as

    in the payment of dividends or in the distribution of assets
    upon Wachovias liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In
    general, no dividend will be paid or declared and no
    distribution will be made on any shares of our common stock, and
    no shares of our common stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or
    otherwise acquired by Wachovia, unless full dividends for that
    dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series J
    Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient
    for the payment thereof set aside. Wachovia may redeem the
    Series J Preferred Stock in whole or in part on any
    dividend payment date on or after December 15, 2017, so
    long as full dividends on all outstanding shares of
    Series J Preferred Stock for the then-current dividend
    period have been paid or declared and set aside for payment. Any
    redemption shall be at the redemption price of $1,000 per share
    of Series J Preferred Stock, plus any dividends that have
    been declared but not paid. Wachovias right to redeem the
    Series J Preferred Stock is subject to the prior approval
    of the Federal Reserve Board. Holders of Series J Preferred
    Stock do not have any right to require the redemption or
    repurchase of the Series J Preferred Stock. Holders of the
    Series J Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except with
    respect to certain fundamental changes in the terms of the
    Series J Preferred Stock and certain other matters as
    required by North Carolina law. In addition, if dividends on the
    Series J Preferred Stock are not paid in full for six
    dividend periods, the holders of the Series J Preferred
    Stock, acting as a class with any other stock having similar
    voting rights, will have the right to elect two directors to
    Wachovias board of directors. The terms of office of these
    directors will end when Wachovia has paid or set aside for
    payment full dividends for four consecutive dividend periods.

 

    On February 8, 2008, Wachovia issued 3,500,000 shares
    of its Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual
    Class A preferred stock, Series K (the
    Series K Preferred Stock), each having a
    liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. The Series K
    Preferred Stock is not listed on any securities exchange. From
    the period between February 8, 2008 and March 15,
    2018, non-cumulative cash dividends on the Series K
    Preferred Stock will be payable if, as and when declared by our
    board of directors, quarterly in arrears on each March 15 and
    September 15 at a per annum rate of 7.98%, beginning on
    September 15, 2008. Thereafter,





 


    non-cumulative cash dividends on the Series K Preferred
    Stock will be payable if, as and when declared by our board of
    directors, quarterly in arrears on each March 15,
    June 15, September 15 and December 15 at a floating rate
    equal to Three-Month LIBOR plus 3.77% per annum,
    beginning on June 15, 2018. With respect to the payment
    of dividends and amounts upon liquidation, the Series K
    Preferred Stock will rank equally with any other class or series
    of our stock that ranks on a par with the Series K
    Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends and in the
    distribution of assets on any liquidation, dissolution or
    winding up of Wachovia (including the Series J Preferred
    Stock), and will rank senior to our common stock in the payment
    of dividends or in the distribution of assets upon
    Wachovias liquidation, dissolution or winding up. In
    general, no dividend will be paid or declared and no
    distribution will be made on any shares of our common stock, and
    no shares of our common stock shall be repurchased, redeemed or
    otherwise acquired by Wachovia, unless full dividends for that
    dividend period on all outstanding shares of Series K
    Preferred Stock have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient
    for the payment thereof set aside. Wachovia may redeem the
    Series K Preferred Stock in whole or in part on any
    dividend payment date on or after March 15, 2018, so long
    as full dividends on all outstanding shares of Series K
    Preferred Stock for the then-current dividend period have been
    paid or declared and set aside for payment. Any redemption shall
    be at the redemption price of $1,000 per share of Series K
    Preferred Stock, plus any dividends that have been declared but
    not paid. Wachovias right to redeem the Series K
    Preferred Stock is subject to the prior approval of the Federal
    Reserve Board. Holders of Series K Preferred Stock do not
    have any right to require the redemption or repurchase of the
    Series K Preferred Stock. Holders of the Series K
    Preferred Stock have no voting rights, except with respect to
    certain fundamental changes in the terms of the Series K
    Preferred Stock and certain other matters as required by North
    Carolina law. In addition, if dividends on the Series K
    Preferred Stock are not paid in full for six dividend periods,
    the holders of the Series K Preferred Stock, acting as a
    class with any other stock having similar voting rights, will
    have the right to elect two directors to Wachovias board
    of directors. The terms of office of these directors will end
    when Wachovia has paid or set aside for payment full dividends
    for four consecutive dividend periods.

 

    In connection with the merger with Legacy Wachovia, holders of
    shares of Legacy Wachovia common stock elected to receive, in
    addition to 2 shares of Wachovia common stock, either a
    one-time $0.48 cash payment or 2 shares of a new class of
    Wachovia preferred stock. At December 31, 2007, 96,536,312
    Wachovia Dividend Equalization Preferred shares
    (DEPs) were outstanding. Because Wachovia paid
    common stock dividends equal to $1.25 per share in the four
    quarters of 2003, holders of DEPs are no longer entitled to
    receive any dividend on the DEPs and Wachovia has ceased to pay
    any such dividends. The DEPs are not listed on a national
    securities exchange and have no voting rights.

 

    Subject to the prior rights of holders of any outstanding shares
    of our preferred stock or Class A preferred stock, holders
    of common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be
    legally declared by our board of directors and, in the event of
    dissolution and liquidation, to receive our net assets remaining
    after payment of all liabilities, in proportion to their
    respective holdings. Additional information concerning certain
    limitations on our payment of dividends is set forth above under
    Business -- Supervision and Regulation; Payment of
    Dividends and in Note 23 on page 135 in the
    Annual Report and incorporated herein by reference.

 

    Under our Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement, each
    outstanding common stock share has a right attached to it. This
    right remains attached unless a separation time occurs. At
    separation time, common shareholders will receive separate
    certificates for these rights. Each right entitles its owner to
    purchase at separation time one one-hundredth of a share of a
    participating series of Class A preferred stock for $105.
    This series of Class A preferred stock would have economic
    and voting terms similar to those of one common stock share.
    Separation time would generally occur at the earlier of the
    following two dates:

 







 
      


    the tenth business day after any person commences a tender or
    exchange offer that entitles that person to 10% or more of our
    outstanding common stock, or


 

 
      


    the tenth business day after we publicly announce that a person
    has acquired beneficial ownership of 10% or more of our
    outstanding common stock.







 

 

    These rights will not trade separately from the shares of common
    stock until a separation time occurs, and may be exercised on
    the business day immediately after the separation time. The
    rights will expire at the earliest of:

 







 
      


    the date on which our board of directors elects to exchange the
    rights for our common stock or preferred stock as described
    below;


 

 
      


    the close of business on December 28, 2010, unless our
    board of directors extends that time; or


 

 
      


    the date on which the rights are terminated as described below.



 

    Once we publicly announce that a person has acquired 10% of our
    outstanding common stock, we can allow for rights holders to buy
    our common stock for half of its market value. For example, we
    would sell to each rights holder common stock shares worth $210
    for $105 in cash. At the same time, any rights held by the 10%
    owner or any of its affiliates, associates or transferees will
    be void. In addition, if we are acquired in a merger or other
    business combination after a person has become a 10% owner, the
    rights held by shareholders would become exercisable to purchase
    the acquiring companys common stock for half of its market
    value.

 

    In the alternative, our board of directors may elect to exchange
    all of the then outstanding rights for shares of common stock at
    an exchange ratio of two common stock shares for one right. Upon
    election of this exchange, a right will no longer be exercisable
    and will only represent a right to receive two common stock
    shares.

 

    If we are required to issue common stock shares upon the
    exercise of rights, or in exchange for rights, our board of
    directors may substitute shares of participating Class A
    preferred stock. The substitution will be at a rate of two one
    one-hundredths of a share of participating Class A
    preferred stock for each right exchanged.

 

    The rights may be terminated without any payment to holders
    before their exercise date. The rights have no voting rights and
    are not entitled to dividends.

 

    The rights will not prevent a takeover of Wachovia. The rights,
    however, may cause substantial dilution to a person or group
    that acquires 10% or more of our common stock unless our board
    first terminates the rights. Nevertheless, the rights should not
    interfere with a transaction that is in Wachovias and its
    shareholders best interests because the board can
    terminate the rights before that transaction is completed.

 

    The complete terms of the rights are contained in the
    Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement. The foregoing
    description of the rights and the rights agreement is qualified
    in its entirety by reference to the agreement. A copy of the
    rights agreement can be obtained upon written request to
    Wachovia Bank, National Association, 301 South College Street,
    Charlotte, North Carolina
    28288-0206.

 

    Additional information relating to our common stock,
    Series J Preferred Stock and the DEPs is set forth in
    Note 12 on pages 104 through 106 in the Annual Report and
    incorporated herein by reference.

 

Purchases
    of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated
    Purchasers.

 

    In August 2005, our board of directors authorized the repurchase
    of 100 million shares of our common stock, which together
    with remaining authority from previous board authorizations in
    1999, 2000, and 2004 permitted Wachovia to repurchase up to
    approximately 150 million shares of our common stock as of
    August 16, 2005, the date that authorization was announced.
    Future stock repurchases may be private or open-market
    purchases, including block transactions, accelerated or delayed
    block transactions, forward transactions, collar transactions,
    and similar transactions. The amount and timing of stock
    repurchases will be based on various factors, such as
    managements assessment of Wachovias capital
    structure and liquidity, the market price of Wachovia common
    stock compared to managements assessment of the
    stocks underlying value, and applicable regulatory, legal
    and accounting factors. In 2007, Wachovia repurchased
    22 million shares of Wachovia common stock, all of such
    repurchases were in the open market, at an average cost of
    $54.35 per share. Please see Stockholders
    Equity on page 35 in the Annual Report for additional
    information about Wachovias





 


    share repurchases in 2007. The following table sets forth
    information about our stock repurchases for the three months
    ended December 31, 2007.

    (2) Pursuant to Wachovias employee stock option
    plans, participants may exercise Wachovia stock options by
    surrendering shares of Wachovia common stock the participants
    already own as payment of the option exercise price. Shares so
    surrendered by participants in Wachovias employee stock
    option plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the
    applicable stock option plan and not pursuant to publicly
    announced share repurchase programs. For the quarter ended
    December 31, 2007, the following shares of Wachovia common
    stock were surrendered by participants in Wachovias
    employee stock option plans: October 2007 
    2,509 shares at an average price per share of $50.91;
    November 2007  11,479 shares at an average price
    per share of $43.96; and December 2007 
    40,384 shares at an average price per share of $43.28.

 

    (3) On May 25, 1999, Wachovia announced a stock
    repurchase program pursuant to which Wachovia was authorized to
    repurchase up to 50 million shares of its common stock. On
    June 26, 2000, Wachovia announced a stock repurchase
    program pursuant to which Wachovia was authorized to repurchase
    up to 50 million shares of its common stock. On
    January 15, 2004, Wachovia announced a stock repurchase
    program pursuant to which Wachovia was authorized to repurchase
    up to 60 million shares of its common stock. On
    August 16, 2005, Wachovia announced a stock repurchase
    program pursuant to which Wachovia was authorized to repurchase
    up to 100 million shares of its common stock. None of these
    programs has an expiration date and each respective program
    expires upon completion of repurchases totaling the amount
    authorized for repurchase. During the second quarter of 2004,
    all remaining shares authorized under the May 1999
    authorization, which totaled approximately 5.2 million
    shares at the beginning of the quarter, were repurchased. During
    the first quarter of 2005, all remaining shares authorized under
    the June 2000 authorization, which totaled approximately
    15.7 million shares at the beginning of the quarter, were
    repurchased. During the first quarter of 2006, all remaining
    shares authorized under the January 2004 authorization, which
    totaled approximately 23.6 million shares at the beginning
    of the quarter, were repurchased. As of December 31, 2007,
    there are no more shares remaining under the May 1999, June 2000
    and January 2004 authorizations, and approximately
    19.5 million shares remaining under the August 2005
    authorization.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As
    of December 31, 2007, the end of the period covered by this
    Annual Report on
    Form 10-K,
    Wachovias management, including Wachovias Chief
    Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
    effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as
    defined in
    Rule 13a-15(e)
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that
    evaluation, Wachovias Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer each concluded that as of December 31,
    2007, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on
    Form 10-K,
    Wachovia maintained effective disclosure controls and procedures.

 

Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Wachovias management is responsible
    for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting (as defined in
    Rule 13a-15(f)
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Wachovias
    internal control over financial reporting is under the general
    oversight of the Board of Directors acting through the Audit
    Committee, which is composed entirely of independent directors.
    KPMG LLP, Wachovias independent auditors, has direct and
    unrestricted access to the Audit Committee at all times, with no
    members of management present, to discuss its audit and any
    other matters that have come to its attention that may affect
    Wachovias accounting, financial reporting or internal
    controls. The Audit Committee meets periodically with
    management, internal auditors and KPMG LLP to determine that
    each is fulfilling its responsibilities and to support actions
    to identify, measure and control risk and augment internal
    control over financial reporting. Internal control over
    financial reporting, however, cannot provide absolute assurance
    of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its
    inherent limitations.

 

    Under the supervision and with the participation of management,
    including Wachovias Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, Wachovia conducted an evaluation of the
    effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2007 based on the framework in
    Internal Control  Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based upon that evaluation, management
    concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was
    effective as of December 31, 2007. Managements report
    on internal control over financial reporting is set forth on
    page 68 in Wachovias 2007 Annual Report, which is
    included as Exhibit (13) to this Annual Report





 


    on
    Form 10-K,
    and is incorporated herein by reference. The effectiveness of
    Wachovias internal control over financial reporting has
    been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent, registered public
    accounting firm, as stated in its report, which is set forth on
    page 69 in Wachovias 2007 Annual Report and is
    incorporated herein by reference.

 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting. No change in our internal control over
    financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter of our
    fiscal year ended December 31, 2007, that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
    Wachovias internal control over financial reporting.

    RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.



 

    In response to this Item, the information set forth in the Proxy
    Statement relating to the ownership of common stock,
    Series J Preferred Stock, Series K Preferred Stock and
    DEPs by our directors, executive officers and principal
    stockholders under the headings Security Ownership of
    Management and Security Ownership of Certain
    Beneficial Owners, is incorporated herein by reference.

 

    In addition, set forth below is certain information relating to
    securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation
    plans and a description of material features of equity
    compensation plans not approved by stockholders.

 

Additional
    Information Regarding Wachovias Equity Compensation
    Plans

 

    We maintain several equity compensation plans.Our current
    primary plan is the Amended and Restated Wachovia Corporation
    2003 Stock Incentive Plan, which is used for stock awards to our
    executive officers as well as other key employees. Our
    shareholders approved the 2003 Plan at our 2003 annual
    shareholders meeting and approved the Amended and Restated
    2003 Plan at a special shareholders meeting in August
    2006. The 2003 Plan is the only plan Wachovia currently uses to
    make stock compensation awards. Prior to adopting the 2003 Plan,
    Wachovia utilized some equity compensation plans that were
    approved by our stockholders and some equity compensation plans
    that were not required to be approved by our stockholders. One
    such plan, named the Wachovia Stock Plan and referred to herein
    as the Legacy Wachovia Stock Plan, was approved by
    Legacy Wachovia stockholders in 1994. See Material
    Features of Stock Plans Not Approved by Stockholders below.

 

    The following table gives information as of December 31,
    2007 with respect to shares of our common stock that may be
    issued under existing stock incentive plans. The table does not
    include information with respect to shares subject to
    outstanding options granted under certain stock incentive plans
    assumed by Wachovia in connection with mergers and acquisitions
    of companies that originally granted those options, including
    Golden West and A.G. Edwards. Footnote (5) to the table
    indicates the total number of shares of common stock issuable
    upon the exercise of options under the assumed plans as of
    December 31, 2007, and the weighted average exercise price
    of those options. No additional options may be granted under
    those assumed plans.

    (1) Following adoption of the 2003 Stock Incentive Plan,
    Wachovia will not issue any future awards from any stock
    compensation plans other than the 2003 Plan. The 2003 Plan
    contains a provision that enables Wachovia to make new stock
    awards under the 2003 Plan equal to the number of forfeited,
    cancelled, terminated, expired





 


    or lapsed stock awards granted under any Wachovia stock plan.
    For purposes of completing this table, Wachovia has assumed that
    none of such forfeitures, cancellations, terminations,
    expirations or lapses will occur. The securities remaining
    available for future issuance set forth in column (c) under
    the 2003 Plan may be in the form of

 







 
      


    stock options,


 

 
      


    stock appreciation rights, or


 

 
      


    stock awards, including restricted stock awards, restricted
    stock units, performance stock awards, performance stock units
    or other awards based on or with a value tied to, shares of
    Wachovia common stock.

    Plan and 1996 Master Stock Compensation Plan, each of which was
    approved by stockholders; however, following adoption of the
    2003 Plan, Wachovia cannot make new stock awards under these
    other plans. As of December 31, 2007, a total of
    33,038,406 shares of Wachovia common stock were issuable
    upon the exercise of outstanding options under the plans set
    forth in (B) of the preceding sentence and the weighted
    average exercise price of those outstanding options is $40.18
    per share.

 

    (3) Represents only shares available for issuance under the

    discussed below under Material Features of Stock Plans
    Not Approved by Stockholders.

 

    (5) The table does not include information for stock
    incentive plans Wachovia assumed in connection with mergers and
    acquisitions of the companies that originally established those
    plans, except for the Legacy Wachovia Stock Plan. As of
    December 31, 2007, a total of 32,478,058 shares of
    common stock were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options
    under those assumed plans. The weighted average exercise price
    of those outstanding options is $31.51 per share. No additional
    options may be granted under those assumed plans.

 

Material
    Features of Stock Plans Not Approved by Stockholders

 

    The following is a brief summary of Wachovias stock
    compensation plans that have not been approved by stockholders.
    Those plans are the 2001 Stock Incentive Plan, the Employee
    Retention Stock Plan and the Legacy Wachovia Stock Plan.
    Wachovia issued stock awards under these plans prior to adoption
    of the 2003 Plan. Wachovia will not issue any future stock
    awards from any of these plans. Our Management
    Resources & Compensation Committee of Wachovias
    board of directors administers all of these plans and has
    authority to make all decisions regarding these plans. These
    plans share the same general features, except as may be set
    forth in more detail below.

 

General.  The plans provide for the grant of
    options and stock awards, including restricted stock awards, to
    non-executive officer employees. The number of shares available
    for previously issued but unexercised options is subject to
    adjustment for any future stock dividends, splits, mergers,
    combinations or other capitalization changes. In the event of a
    change in control of Wachovia, all outstanding awards under the
    plans will be immediately exercisable
    and/or fully
    vested, as the case may be. The Legacy Wachovia board and
    stockholders adopted the Legacy Wachovia Stock Plan in April
    1994. The Legacy Wachovia Stock Plan was further amended and
    restated effective April 2002 by Wachovia following the merger
    between Legacy First Union and Legacy Wachovia. Legacy First
    Unions board of directors adopted the 2001 Stock Incentive
    Plan in July 2001 and adopted the Employee Retention Stock Plan
    in April 2000.

 

Options.  Each option granted under the plans
    is evidenced by a written award agreement that specifies the
    type of option granted, the option exercise price, the option
    duration, the vesting date(s) and the number of shares of common
    stock subject to the option. No option granted under the plans
    has an option exercise price that is less than the fair market
    value of the common stock on the option grant date. No option
    will be exercisable later than the tenth anniversary date of its
    grant.

 

    Payment of the option price upon exercise may be made
    (i) in cash, (ii) by tendering shares of previously
    owned common stock having a fair market value at the time of
    exercise equal to the total option exercise price,
    (iii) cashless exercise through a broker, or (iv) by a
    combination of the foregoing.





 


2001 Stock Incentive Plan and Employee Retention
    Plan.  Unless the compensation committee
    determines otherwise, in the event the employment of a
    participant is terminated by reason of death, disability or
    retirement, any outstanding options will become immediately
    exercisable at any time prior to the earlier of the expiration
    date of the options or within three years after employment
    ceases. If the employment of the participant terminates for any
    other reason, unless the compensation committee determines
    otherwise, the rights under any then outstanding and
    unexercisable options will be forfeited and the rights under any
    then outstanding and exercisable options will be forfeited upon
    the earlier of the option expiration date or three months after
    the day employment ends.

 

Legacy Wachovia Stock Plan.  Unless the
    compensation committee determines otherwise, in the event the
    employment of a participant is terminated by reason of
    displacement, death, disability or retirement, any outstanding
    options will become immediately exercisable at any time prior to
    the earlier of the expiration date of the options or within a
    certain period after employment ceases, depending on the date of
    option grant. If the employment of the participant terminates
    for any other reason, unless the compensation committee
    determines otherwise, the rights under any then outstanding and
    unexercisable options will be forfeited and the rights under any
    then outstanding and exercisable options will be forfeited upon
    the earlier of the option expiration date or three months after
    the day employment ends.

 

Stock Awards.  During the period of
    restriction, participants holding shares of restricted stock may
    exercise full voting rights and be entitled to receive all
    dividends and other distributions paid with respect to those
    shares while they are so held. If any such dividends or
    distributions are paid in shares of common stock, the shares
    will be subject to the same restrictions on transferability as
    the shares of restricted stock with respect to which they were
    paid. Under the Legacy Wachovia Stock Plan, if the stock awards
    are in the form of restricted stock units, the participant will
    not have voting rights with respect to those restricted units
    and may receive dividend equivalent rights if provided in the
    applicable award agreement.

 

2001 Stock Incentive Plan and Employee Retention
    Plan.  Unless the compensation committee
    determines otherwise, in the event that a participant terminates
    employment because of normal retirement, death or disability,
    any remaining period of restriction applicable to the stock
    award will terminate automatically. Unless the compensation
    committee determines otherwise, if the employment of a
    participant terminates for any reason other than death,
    disability or normal retirement, then any stock awards subject
    to restrictions on the date of such termination will
    automatically be forfeited on the day employment terminates;
    provided, however, if employment terminates due to early
    retirement or any involuntary termination by Wachovia, the
    compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, waive the
    automatic forfeiture of any or all such stock awards
    and/or may
    add such new restrictions to such stock awards as it deems
    appropriate.

 

Legacy Wachovia Stock Plan.  Unless the
    compensation committee determines otherwise, in the event that a
    participant terminates employment because of displacement,
    retirement, death or disability, any remaining period of
    restriction applicable to the stock award terminates
    automatically. Unless the compensation committee determines
    otherwise, if the employment of a participant terminates for any
    reason other than death, disability or normal retirement, then
    any stock awards subject to restrictions on the date of such
    termination will automatically be forfeited on the day
    employment terminates; provided, however, if employment
    terminates due to early retirement or any involuntary
    termination by Wachovia, the compensation committee may, in its
    sole discretion, waive the automatic forfeiture of any or all
    such stock awards
    and/or may
    add such new restrictions to such stock awards as it deems
    appropriate. Except as may otherwise be provided in the Legacy
    Wachovia Stock Plan or as the compensation committee otherwise
    determines, in the event that a participant terminates
    employment with Wachovia for any reason other than as set forth
    above, or for any reason provided for in the terms of the grant,
    then any shares of restricted stock still subject to
    restrictions at the date of such termination shall automatically
    be forfeited.

 

SARs.  The Employee Retention Stock Plan and
    the Legacy Wachovia Stock Plan provided for awards of stock
    appreciation rights, or SARs, to participants. An
    SAR represents a right to receive a payment in cash, common
    stock, or a combination of both, equal to the excess of the fair
    market value of a specified number of shares of common stock on
    the date the SAR is exercised over an amount equal to the fair
    market value on the date the SAR was granted (or the option
    exercise price for SARs granted in tandem with an option). Each
    SAR grant is evidenced by an award agreement specifying the SAR
    exercise price, duration, the number of





 


    shares of common stock subject to the SAR, and whether the SAR
    is granted in tandem with an option or is freestanding. SARs
    granted in tandem with an option may be exercised for all or
    part of the shares subject to the related option but only to the
    extent that the related option is then exercisable.

 

    If the employment of a participant terminates by reason of
    displacement, death, disability or normal retirement, any then
    outstanding SARs granted to the participant will become
    immediately exercisable. Unless the compensation committee
    determines otherwise, any such outstanding SARs will be
    forfeited on the expiration date of the SARs or within a certain
    period after employment terminates, depending on the date of
    grant. Unless the compensation committee determines otherwise,
    if a participants employment terminates for any reason
    other than displacement, death, disability or normal retirement,
    (i) any then outstanding but unexercisable SARs granted to
    the participant will be forfeited, and (ii) any then
    outstanding and exercisable SARs granted to the participant will
    be forfeited on the expiration date of the SARs or three months
    after employment terminates, whichever period is shorter.

      (b) Business Segments

      The Company is a global investment banking, securities and derivatives
trading, clearance and brokerage firm operating in three principal segments:
Capital Markets, Global Clearing Services and Wealth Management. These segments
are analyzed separately due to the distinct nature of the products offered and
the clients they serve. Certain Capital Markets products are distributed by the
Wealth Management and Global Clearing Services distribution networks, with the
related revenues of such intersegment services allocated to the respective
segments.

      Financial information regarding the Company's business segments and
foreign operations as of November 30, 2007, November 30, 2006, and November 30,

                                      -4-


2005 and for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2007, November 30, 2006 and
November 30, 2005 is set forth under ""Item 8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data,"" in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
entitled ""Segment and Geographic Area Data,"" and is incorporated herein by
reference.

      A summary of the business and activities within each of the three
segments, Capital Markets, Global Clearing Services and Wealth Management, is
described below.

CAPITAL MARKETS

      Capital Markets is comprised of the Company's Equities, Fixed Income and
Investment Banking businesses operating as a single integrated unit, providing
sales, trading and origination effort for various equity, fixed income, and
advisory products and services. Each of the three businesses works in tandem to
deliver these services to institutional and corporate clients.

Equities

      General. Equities provides global institutional investing customers with
proficient trade execution and consistent liquidity on global securities
exchanges, prime brokerage services, correspondent clearing services for other
broker-dealers and equity derivatives. Fees and commissions are earned from
agency and principal sales of products such as exchange-traded equity
securities, new equity securities issued, convertible bonds, listed options,
structured equity derivatives, and risk and convertible arbitrage. Additionally,
the division earns commission payments for providing proprietary research on
securities of companies located worldwide. Commissions are also earned for
providing innovative investment management products that model equity investment
risk.

      Institutional Equity. Institutional Equities is one of the leading
providers of complete brokerage services to institutional investors located
globally. Operating from various branch offices worldwide, Institutional
Equities' sales, trading and research professionals provide consistent
liquidity, proficient trade execution, proprietary securities research,
investment advice, equity risk management and access to capital markets
worldwide.

      Institutional Equities provides a complete offering of trade executions of
equity securities including: as agent on global exchanges, using algorithmic
strategies, portfolio executions and as principal. Institutional Equities'
ability to provide Direct Market Access (""DMA"") executions to its global
institutional investor customer base provides liquidity, global capital markets
access and large order flow at competitive commission rates.

      Structured Equity Products. The Company offers to institutional customers,
and trades for its own account, a variety of exchange-traded and OTC equity
derivative products. These products are transacted, as principal, with customers
for hedging, risk management, investment, financing and other purposes. These
transactions are in the form of swaps, options, and structured notes, as well as
more complex, structured trades which are customized to meet customers' specific
needs. Derivatives enable customers to build tailor-made risk/return profiles,
customize transaction terms, develop packaged solutions to a problem, implement
trades that otherwise could not be executed and to transact business with
standardized documentation. The Company, through BSSC and other subsidiaries,
provides, directly or through third-party brokers, futures commission merchant
services for customers and other Bear Stearns affiliates who trade contracts in
futures on financial instruments and physical commodities, including options on
futures.

      Arbitrage. The Company engages for its own account in both ""classic"" and
""risk"" arbitrage. The Company's risk arbitrage activities generally focus on
traditional risk arbitrage, event-driven and capital structure situations where
equity, debt and derivative securities involved in speculated or announced
mergers, stock repurchases, spin-offs or major restructurings are analyzed and
traded by the department for U.S. and European transactions.

                                      -5-


      In classic arbitrage, the Company seeks to profit from temporary
discrepancies (i) between the price of a security in two or more markets, (ii)
between the price of a convertible security and its underlying security, (iii)
between securities that are, or will be, exchangeable at a future date and (iv)
between the prices of securities with contracts settling on different dates. The
Company also examines relative value strategies which focus on pairs of equities
or different levels of the capital structure of the same firm. In these relative
value cases, the Company believes compelling reasons exist for the prices of the
securities to be highly correlated.

      Convertible Securities. The Company engages in the sales and trading of
equity-linked securities including convertible bonds, convertible preferreds,
equity-linked notes and warrants. Market coverage includes the U.S., Europe,
Asia and Latin America.

       Electronic Connectivity and Trading. Bear Stearns' Equity Analytics
Systematic Trading (""E.A.S.T."") system currently includes the following
products: U.S. Domestic and European Algorithms, Global Pre- and Post-Trade
Analytics, Smart Order Routing, EASTrader, and Pairs Trading, using competitive
statistical models such as Risk Models and Transaction Cost Models.

      Specialist and Market-Making. The Company engages in specialist and
market-making activities on the NYSE, AMEX and ISE. The Company performs
specialist and market making functions in NYSE-Arca listed, and AMEX-listed
stocks and exchange traded funds, and performs market-making functions for
options traded on the ISE. The rules of these exchanges generally require
specialists to maintain orderly markets in the securities for which they are
specialists, which may require commitments of a significant amount of capital to
the Company's specialist businesses. As market-makers, specialists are obligated
to take positions in their issues counter to the direction of the market in
order to minimize short-term imbalances in the auction market, involving risk of
loss during periods of market fluctuation and volatility.

      Equity Research. The Global Equity Research Department provides in-depth,
thematic research underpinned by detailed financial models. The department
disseminates independent third party research reports and ratings on U.S.
covered companies as well as foreign securities with liquid American Depository
Receipts. In 2007, Global Equity Research expanded its coverage most rapidly in
the European and Asian sectors, adding over 100 companies to the coverage
universe in those regions. Global Equity Research as of November 30, 2007
provided research coverage of approximately 1,200 companies worldwide in over
100 industries. Global Equity Research is also an innovator in deploying
technology to help clients access and analyze research including BearCast(TM), a
podcasting tool, BearXplorer, a patented risk management product, and the use of
RSS (Really Simple Syndication) to apprise analysts and clients of breaking
news.

      Energy. The Company trades as principal and maintains proprietary trading
positions in the spot, forward and futures markets in several commodities,
including natural gas, electric power, crude oil, emission credits, coal and
related products through our subsidiaries in the U.S. and Europe including Bear
Energy L.P. (""Bear Energy""). In addition, the Company has equity ownership
interests in various power generation facilities and related assets through a
subsidiary, Arroyo Energy.

      In November 2007, Bear Energy purchased substantially all of the assets of
Williams Power Company, Inc., an energy trading and marketing subsidiary of The

consolidation and convergence as institutions involved in a broad range of
financial services industries have either ceased operations or have been
acquired by or merged into other firms. As a result, competitors have gained
geographic reach and have increased capital, and other resources, such as the
ability to offer a wider range of products and services. In particular, the
Company encounters intense competition in all aspects of its securities business
both domestically and internationally, particularly in underwriting, trading and
advisory services. In many cases, the Company competes directly with other
securities firms having substantially greater capital and resources, and
offering a wider range of financial services than the Company. The Company's
competitors include other brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment
banking firms, investment advisors, mutual funds, hedge funds, private equity
funds and insurance companies.

      The Company believes that the principal factors affecting competition are
the caliber and talent of professional personnel, the array of services and
products offered, the quality of service provided, transaction execution,
reputation and price.

      (d)   Employees

      As of November 30, 2007, the Company had 14,153 employees. The Company
considers its relationship with its employees to be good.

      (e) Regulatory and Compliance Factors Affecting the Company and the
      Securities Industry

      The financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation in the
U.S. and the other countries in which the Company operates. As a matter of
public policy, regulators around the world are charged with safeguarding the
integrity of the securities and other financial markets and with protecting the
interests of people and entities participating in those markets. Violation of
these regulations can subject a company to legal and administrative proceedings,
which may result in censures, fines, cease-and-desist orders, restrictions on
business activities, which could result in significant losses and reputational
damages.

      U.S. Regulation: The securities industry in the U.S. is subject to
extensive regulation under both federal and state laws. Moreover, Bear Stearns
and BSSC are registered as broker-dealers and investment advisers with the SEC.
Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory
organizations, principally the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(""FINRA""), which has been designated by the SEC as the primary regulator of
certain of the Company's subsidiaries, including Bear Stearns and BSSC, and
these self-regulatory organizations (i) adopt rules, subject to approval by the
SEC, that govern the industry and (ii) conduct periodic examinations of the
operations of the Company's broker-dealer subsidiaries. Securities firms are
also subject to regulation by state securities administrators in those states
where they conduct business.

                                      -12-


      U.S. broker-dealers are subject to rules and regulations that cover all
aspects of the securities business including: sales methods; trade practices;
use and safekeeping of customer funds and securities; capital structures;
recordkeeping; the preparation of research; the extension of credit and the
conduct of officers and employees. Much of this regulation is embodied in the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and rules promulgated thereunder, as
well as the rules of self-regulatory organizations such as the FINRA. The types
of regulations to which investment advisers are subject also are extensive and
include: recordkeeping; fee arrangements; client disclosure; custody of customer
assets; and the conduct of officers and employees. Much of this regulation is
embodied in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and rules promulgated
thereunder. The mode of operation and profitability of broker-dealers or
investment advisers may be directly affected by new legislation, changes in
rules promulgated by the SEC and self-regulatory organizations and changes in
the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules. The SEC,
self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions may conduct
administrative proceedings that can result in censures, fines, the issuance of
cease-and-desist orders and the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer or an
investment adviser, its officers or employees. The principal purpose of
regulation and discipline of broker-dealers and investment advisers is the
protection of customers and the securities markets, rather than the protection
of creditors and stockholders of broker-dealers or investment advisers.

      The Market Reform Act of 1990 (the ""Market Reform Act"") was adopted to
strengthen the SEC's regulatory oversight of the national securities markets and
increase the efficacy and stability of such markets by, among other things: (i)
providing the SEC with discretion to halt securities trading on any national
exchange for the protection of investors; (ii) requiring broker-dealers and
other registrants to regularly provide information to the SEC regarding holding
companies and other affiliated entities whose activities can impact their
financial condition; (iii) requiring broker-dealers and other registrants who
execute large-trade orders to provide information to the SEC regarding such
transactions; and (iv) allowing the SEC to prosecute market participants who
violate SEC rules and regulations designed to maintain fair and orderly markets.

      The Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 was
adopted to strengthen the SEC's ability to deter, detect and punish insider
trading by, among other things: (i) increasing civil penalties that can be
assessed against controlling persons who purposefully or recklessly fail to take
adequate measures to prevent insider trading; (ii) allowing the SEC to provide
cash rewards to individuals who provide evidence of insider trading; (iii)
affirming the government's ability to obtain criminal sanctions against those
found guilty of insider trading; and (iv) requiring broker-dealers and
investment advisers to establish and enforce written procedures reasonably
designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic information.

      The Government Securities Act of 1986 was adopted to decrease volatility
and increase investor confidence and liquidity in the government securities
market by creating a coordinated and comprehensive regulatory structure for the
market where none had previously existed. In particular, the Government
Securities Act: (i) requires broker-dealers solely involved in government
securities transactions to register with the SEC; (ii) allows the Secretary of
the Treasury to adopt rules regarding the custody, use, transfer and control of
government securities; and (iii) bestows upon the SEC authority to enforce such
rules as to broker-dealers and other SEC registrants.

      The futures industry in the U.S. is subject to regulation under the
Commodity Exchange Act, as amended. The Commodities Futures Trading Commission
(""CFTC"") is the federal agency charged with the administration of the Commodity
Exchange Act and the regulations thereunder. Bear Stearns and BSSC are
registered with the CFTC as futures commission merchants and are subject to
regulation as such by the CFTC and various domestic boards of trade and other
futures exchanges. Bear Stearns' and BSSC's futures business is also regulated
by the National Futures Association, a not-for-profit membership organization,
which has been designated a registered futures association by the CFTC.

      As registered broker-dealers and member firms of the FINRA, both Bear
Stearns and BSSC are subject to the Net Capital Rule (Rule 15c3-1) (the ""Net
Capital Rule"") under the Exchange Act, which has been adopted through
incorporation by reference in Rule 325 NYSE, as incorporated into the FINRA
rulebook. The Net Capital Rule, which specifies minimum net capital requirements
for registered broker-dealers, is designed to measure the general financial
integrity and liquidity of broker-dealers and requires that at least a minimal
portion of a broker-dealer's assets be kept in relatively liquid form.

                                      -13-


      The Company has consented to be regulated under the ""Alternative Net
Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers That Are Part of Consolidated Supervised
Entities"" (Rule 34-49830) (""CSE"") that allow investment banks to voluntarily
submit to be supervised by the SEC on a global consolidated basis. As a result,
the Company now: computes allowable capital and allowances for market, credit
and operational risk on a consolidated basis in accordance with standards
prescribed in Appendix G to the Net Capital Rules; and permits the SEC to
examine the books and records of the Parent Company and any affiliate that does
not have a principal regulator. The Company is in compliance with the CSE
regulatory capital requirements.

      Bear Stearns and BSSC are also subject to the net capital requirements of
the CFTC and various futures exchanges, which generally require that Bear
Stearns and BSSC maintain a minimum net capital equal to the greater of the
alternative net capital requirement provided for under the Exchange Act or 8% of
the total risk maintenance margin requirements for positions carried in customer
accounts plus 4% of the total risk maintenance margin requirements for positions
carried in non-customer accounts, in each case as defined in Rule 1.17 of the
CFTC.

      Domestic futures and options trading are subject to extensive regulation
by the CFTC, pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission Act of 1974. International futures and options trading
activities are subject to regulation by the respective regulatory authorities in
the locations where futures exchanges reside, including the FSA in the United
Kingdom.

      Margin requirements (good faith deposits) covering substantially all
transactions in futures and options contracts are subject to each particular
exchange's requirements in addition to other regulations. In the U.S., the
Company, through BSSC and other subsidiaries, is a clearing member of the
Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, New York Mercantile
Exchange and other principal futures exchanges.

      Compliance with the Net Capital Rule could limit those operations of Bear
Stearns and/or BSSC that require significant capital usage, such as
underwriting, trading and the financing of customer margin account debit
balances. The Net Capital Rule could also restrict the Company's ability to
withdraw capital from Bear Stearns or BSSC, which in turn could limit the
Company's ability to pay dividends, pay interest, repay debt, or redeem or
purchase shares of its outstanding capital stock. Additional information
regarding net capital requirements is set forth under ""Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data"" in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements entitled ""Regulatory Requirements"".

      The activities of the Company's bank and trust company subsidiary, CTC,
are regulated by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the
FDIC. FDIC regulations require certain disclosures in connection with joint
advertising or promotional activities conducted by Bear Stearns and CTC. Such
regulations also restrict certain activities of CTC in connection with the
securities business of Bear Stearns. The Competitive Equality in Banking Act of
1987, as amended, limits the use of overdrafts at Federal Reserve Banks on
behalf of affiliates.

      Bear Energy is authorized by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(""FERC"") to sell wholesale physical power at a market-based rate. As a
FERC-authorized power marketer, Bear Energy is subject to regulation under the
Federal Power Act and FERC regulations. In addition, as a result of our
interests in

                                      -14-


electrical power generation facilities, we are subject to extensive and evolving
federal, state and local energy, environmental and other governmental laws and
regulations relating to, among others, air quality, waste management, natural
resources, site remediation and, health and safety.

      Anti-Money Laundering: The USA Patriot Act of 2001 contains anti-money
laundering laws that mandate the implementation of various regulations
applicable to banks, broker-dealers and other financial services firms,
including standards for verifying client identity at account opening, and
obligations to monitor client transactions and report superstitious activity.
Through these and other provisions, the USA Patriot Act seeks to promote
cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement in
identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering.
Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain similar provisions. The
Company has established policies and procedures, and internal controls that are
designed to comply with these rules and regulations.

      Non-U.S. Regulation: Both BSIL and BSIT are authorized and regulated in
the United Kingdom by the FSA, pursuant to The Financial Services and Markets
Act 2000. The FSA regulates all aspects of the financial services industry in
the United Kingdom and its Rules cover: senior management responsibilities,
regulatory capital, sales and trading practices, safekeeping of customer funds,
record keeping, registration standards for individuals and reporting,
disclosures to customers and other matters.

      In the United Kingdom, the Company, through BSIL, is a member of the
International Petroleum Exchange (""IPE""), London Metals Exchange (""LME"")
Euronext Liffe (""LIFFE""), Eurex AG Frankfurt and the European Derivatives
Exchange (""EDX""). BSIL also has non-clearing memberships with Euronext Paris and
Euronext Amsterdam. In Japan, memberships are held by the Company through Bear
Stearns (Japan), Limited (""BSJL"") with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (""TSE""),
the Osaka Securities Exchange Co., Ltd (""OSE"") and the Tokyo International
Financial Futures Exchange (""TIFFE"").

      BSJL is licensed with and regulated by the Financial Services Agency of
Japan. BSJL is a limited trade participant to the OSE and has a membership on
the TSE and TIFFE. Bear Stearns Hong Kong Limited is registered as a Commodities
Dealer with the Securities and Futures Commission (""SFC"") in Hong Kong. BSAL is
registered as a Securities Dealer with the SFC in Hong Kong and is a participant
(i.e. member) of the Hong Kong Exchange Limited. BSSP has a Capital Market
Service license to conduct regulated activities in Dealing in Securities and
Advising on Corporate Finance.

      BSB was registered with the Irish Companies Registration Office on
November 27, 1995. BSB was granted a banking license on April 10, 1997 in
accordance with the Irish Central Bank Act, 1971 and is regulated by the
Financial Regulator in Ireland.

      Insurance: Bear Stearns and BSSC are members of the Securities Investor
Protection Corporation (""SIPC""), which provides protection for customer accounts
held by these entities of up to $500,000 for each customer, with a limit of
$100,000 for cash balances, in the event of the liquidation of a broker-dealer.
In addition, all BSSC security accounts are protected by an excess securities
bond issued by the Customer Asset Protection Company up to the amount of the
account's total net equity (both cash and securities) in excess of the
underlying SIPC protection.

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.

      In addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the
exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in
evaluating our business. A discussion of the policies and procedures used to
identify, assess and manage certain risks is set forth under the caption ""Risk
Management"" in the Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference to
Exhibit No. 13 of this report. Our business, financial condition or results of
operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by any of these
risks. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem
immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, or
results of operations.

      Our businesses could be adversely affected by market fluctuations. Our
businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and
economic conditions generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere

                                      -15-


around the world. In the event of a market downturn, our businesses could be
adversely affected in many ways, including those described below. Our revenues
are likely to decline in such circumstances and, if we were unable to reduce
expenses at the same pace, our profit margins would erode. In addition, in the
event of extreme market events, such as the global credit crisis, we could incur
significant losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to
substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.

      Market fluctuations and volatility may cause us to incur significant
losses in our trading and investment activities. We generally maintain large
trading and investment positions in the fixed income, currency, commodity and
equity markets. To the extent that we own assets, i.e., have long positions, in
any of those markets, a downturn in those markets could result in losses from a
decline in the value of those long positions. Conversely, to the extent that we
have sold assets we do not own, i.e., have short positions, in any of those
markets, an upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially unlimited
losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a
rising market. In addition, we maintain substantial trading positions that can
be adversely affected by the level of volatility in the financial markets, i.e.,
the degree to which trading prices fluctuate over a particular period, in a
particular market, regardless of market levels.

      Our businesses may be adversely affected by fluctuations in interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices. In connection
with our dealer and arbitrage activities, including market-making in OTC
derivative contracts, we may be adversely affected by changes in the level or
volatility of interest rates, mortgage prepayment speeds or the level and shape
of the yield curve. Increasing interest rates may cause a decline in the volume
of mortgage origination activity and therefore securitization activity.
Declining real estate values could also reduce the level of new mortgage loan
originations and securitizations. When we buy or sell a foreign currency or a
financial instrument denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, exposure
exists from a net open currency position. Until the position is covered by
selling or buying the equivalent amount of the same currency or by entering into
a financing arrangement denominated in the same currency, we are exposed to a
risk that the exchange rate may move against us. We are also exposed to equity
price risk through making markets in equity securities, distressed debt, equity
derivatives as well as specialist activities. We may be adversely affected by
changes in the level or volatility of equity prices, which affect the value of
equity securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular
stock, a basket of stocks or a stock index. Additionally we may be exposed to
widening credit spreads and/or increasing interest rates which creates a less
favorable environment for certain lines of business. Credit spread risk arises
from the potential that changes in an issuer's credit rating or credit
perception could affect the value of financial instruments. The markets for
energy and energy-related commodities are likely to continue to be volatile. Use
of standard commodity contracts (many of which constitute derivatives) can
create volatility in earnings and may require substantial credit support, some
of which may be in the form of cash collateral, increases to which may result in
the event of an adverse change to our credit ratings. Wide fluctuations in
commodity prices might result from relatively minor changes in the supply or
demand for these commodities, market uncertainty and other factors beyond our
control, including natural disasters and changes to the legal and regulatory
landscape.

      The current global credit crisis, inventory exposure, and potential
counterparty credit exposure, may continue to adversely affect our business and
financial results. During 2007, higher interest rates, falling property prices
and a significant increase in the number of subprime mortgages originated in
2005 and 2006 contributed to dramatic increases in mortgage delinquencies and
defaults in 2007 and anticipated future delinquencies among high-risk, or
subprime, borrowers in the United States. The widespread dispersion of credit
risk related to mortgage delinquencies and defaults through the securitization
of mortgage-backed securities, sales of collateralized debt obligations (""CDOs"")
and the creation of structured investment vehicles (""SIVs"") and the unclear
impact on large banks of mortgage-backed securities, CDOs and SIVs caused banks
to reduce their loans to each other or make them at higher interest rates.
Similarly, the ability of corporations to obtain funds through the issuance of
commercial paper or other short-term unsecured sources was negatively impacted.
As prices declined and delinquencies increased, investors lost confidence in the
rating system for structured products as rating agencies moved to downgrade CDOs
and other structured products. In addition, investors lost confidence in
commercial paper conduits and SIVs causing concerns over large potential
liquidations of AAA collateral. The lack of liquidity and transparency regarding
the underlying assets in securitizations, CDOs and SIVs resulted in significant
price declines across all mortgage-related products in fiscal 2007. Price
declines were further driven by forced sales of assets in order to meet demands
by investors for the return of their collateral and collateral calls by lenders.
Many banks and institutional investors have also recognized substantial losses
as they revalue their CDOs and other mortgage-related assets downward. During
the second half of 2007, the economic impact of these problems spread on a
global basis and disrupted the broader financial markets. The combination of
these events caused a large number of mortgage lenders and some hedge funds to
shut down or file for bankruptcy. The deterioration and recognition of
substantial exposure through derivatives and policies written by monoline
insurers resulted in the downgrade of certain of these monoline insurers.
Several of these monoline insurers also reported significant losses. Further
downgrades of these monoline insurers or their failure could result in
additional significant write-downs at many financial institutions and could have
a material adverse effect on the broader financial markets. Financial
institutions have entered into large numbers of credit default swaps with
counterparties to hedge credit risk. As a result of the global credit crises and
the increasingly large numbers of credit defaults, there is a risk that
counterparties could fail, shut down, file for bankruptcy or be unable to pay
out contracts. The failure of a significant number of counterparties or a
counterparty that holds a significant amount of credit default swaps could have
a material adverse effect on the broader financial markets. It is difficult to
predict how long these conditions will continue, whether they will continue to
deteriorate and which of our markets, products and businesses will continue to
be adversely affected. As a result, these conditions could adversely affect our
financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be subject to
increased regulatory scrutiny and litigation due to these issues and events.


                                      -16-


      We are an underwriter and market-maker for, residential and commercial
mortgages, U.S. agency-backed mortgage products, asset-backed securities and
CDOs. We purchase and originate commercial and residential mortgage loans of
varying quality. The markets for these instruments remain extremely illiquid and
as a result, the valuation of our CDOs and subprime related exposures is complex
and involves a comprehensive process, including the use of quantitative modeling
and management judgment. Valuation of these exposures will also continue to be
impacted by external market factors, including default rates, rating agency
actions, and the prices at which observable market transactions occur. Our
ability to mitigate our exposures by selling or hedging our exposures is also
limited by the market environment. Our future results may continue to be
materially impacted by the valuation adjustments that we apply to our portfolio
of residential and commercial mortgages, other asset-backed securities and CDOs.

      Long-term power generation purchase contracts without corresponding
long-term power sale contracts might expose us to fluctuations in the wholesale
power markets and negatively affect our results of operations. We have entered
into agreements with certain power generation facilities to purchase all or a
substantial portion of their power generation capacity. Where there is a
corresponding long-term power sale contract, we have attempted to mitigate
risks; however, factors beyond our control, such as natural disasters impacting
a particular power generating facility or the viability of our counterparties
under such long-term power sale contracts, may cause an adverse impact to our
results of operations. To the extent we do not have a corresponding long-term
power sale contract in place, we will look to sell all or a portion of the power
capacity and other products available from certain generation facilities to the
wholesale power markets. These sales are not subject to traditional cost-based
regulation, therefore we sell these products at prices determined by the
applicable market, which may be adversely impacted by wide fluctuations in
commodity prices due to circumstances beyond our control. As a result, we are
not guaranteed any particular rate of return on our capital investments in
long-term power generation purchase contracts through mandated rates, and our
revenues and results of operations depend upon current and forward market prices
for power and related products.

      Our investment banking revenues may decline in adverse market or economic
conditions. Unfavorable financial or economic conditions would likely reduce the
number and size of transactions in which we provide underwriting, mergers and
acquisitions advisory and other services. Our investment banking revenues, in
the form of financial advisory and underwriting fees, are directly related to
the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and would
therefore be adversely affected by a sustained market downturn. In particular,
our results of operations would be adversely affected by a significant reduction
in the number or size of mergers and acquisitions transactions.

      We may generate lower revenues from commissions and asset management fees
in a market downturn. A market downturn could lead to a decline in the volume of
transactions that we execute for our customers and, therefore, to a decline in
the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. In addition, because the
fees that we charge for managing our clients' portfolios are in many cases based
on the value of those portfolios, a market downturn that reduces the value of
our clients' portfolios or increases the amount of withdrawals would reduce the
revenue we receive from our asset management business.

      Our risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to
unidentified or unanticipated risk. The policies and procedures we use to
identify, assess and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses are
set forth under the caption ""Risk Management"" in the Annual Report, which is
incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13 of this report. We have
devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and
procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our
policies and procedures to identify, assess and manage risks may not be fully
effective. Some of our methods of managing risk are based upon our use of
observed historical market behavior. As a result, these methods may not predict
future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical
measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend upon evaluation of
information regarding markets, clients or other matters that is publicly
available or otherwise accessible by us. This information may not in all cases
be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of
operational, legal and regulatory risk requires, among other things, policies
and procedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and
events, and these policies and procedures may not be fully effective.

                                      -17-


      Liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize
our financial condition. Liquidity, i.e., ready access to funds, is essential to
our businesses. Our sources of liquidity are set forth under the caption
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Liquidity, Funding and Capital"" in the Annual Report, which is
incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13 of this report. An inability
to raise money in the long-term or short-term debt markets, or to engage in
repurchase agreements or securities lending, could have a substantial negative
effect on our liquidity. Our access to debt in amounts adequate to finance our
activities could be impaired by factors that affect us in particular or the
financial services industry in general. For example, lenders could develop a
negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects if we
incurred large trading losses, if the level of our business activity decreased
due to a market downturn or if regulatory authorities took significant action
against us. Our ability to borrow in the debt markets also could be impaired by
factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the
financial markets or negative views about the prospects for the investment
banking, securities or financial services industries generally.

      A reduction in our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity and
competitive position and increase our borrowing costs. Our access to external
sources of financing, as well as the cost of that financing, is dependent on
various factors and could be adversely affected by a deterioration of our
long-and short-term debt ratings, which are influenced by a number of factors.
These include, but are not limited to: material changes in operating margins;
earnings trends and volatility; the prudence of funding and liquidity management
practices; financial leverage on an absolute basis or relative to peers; the
composition of the balance sheet and/or capital structure; geographic and
business diversification; and our market share and competitive position in the
business segments in which we operate. Material deterioration in any one or a
combination of these factors could result in a downgrade of our credit ratings,
thus increasing the cost of and/or limiting the availability of unsecured
financing. Additionally, a reduction in our credit ratings could also trigger
incremental collateral requirements, predominantly in the OTC derivatives
market.

      As a holding company, The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. is dependent on its
subsidiaries for funds. The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. is a holding company
and, therefore, depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its
subsidiaries to fund dividend payments and to fund all payments on its
obligations, including debt obligations. Many of its subsidiaries are subject to
laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from
those subsidiaries to The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. Regulatory action of that
kind could impede access to funds that The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. needs to
make payments on obligations, including debt obligations, or dividend payments.
See ""Item 1. Business - Regulatory and Compliance Factors Affecting the Company
and the Securities Industry"".

      We are exposed to risks resulting from non-performance by counterparties,
customers, borrowers or debt security issuers. We are exposed to credit risk in
our role as trading counterparty to dealers and customers, as direct lender, as
holder of securities and as member of exchanges and clearing organizations. We
are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or
other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on
their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational
failure or other reasons. The policies and procedures we use to manage credit
risk are set forth under the caption ""Risk Management - Credit Risk"" in the
Annual Report, which is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13 of
this report. There can be no assurances that these policies and procedures will
effectively mitigate our exposure to credit risk.

      Operational risks may disrupt our businesses, result in regulatory action
against us or limit our growth. Operational risk is the potential for loss
arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems, or from
external events. This includes, but is not limited to, limitations in our
financial systems and controls, deficiencies in legal documentation,
non-compliance with the execution of legal, regulatory and fiduciary
responsibilities, deficiencies in technology and the risk of loss attributable
to operational problems. Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to
process, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and
diverse markets in many currencies, and the transactions we process have become
increasingly complex. Consequently, we rely heavily on our financial, accounting
and other data processing systems. If any of these systems do not operate
properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial loss, a disruption of our
businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational
damage.

                                      -18-


      Litigation, governmental investigations and/or other legal proceedings
could adversely affect our business. We and certain of our subsidiaries are
involved in litigation, government investigations; and other legal proceedings
that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Litigation
is inherently unpredictable, and excessive verdicts do occur. Although we
believe we have substantial defenses in these matters, we could in the future
incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations in any particular period. See ""Item
3. Legal Proceedings"", for a discussion of certain of the legal matters in which
we are currently exposed to.

      Extensive regulation of our businesses limits our activities and may
subject us to significant penalties. The financial services industry is subject
to extensive regulation. We are subject to regulation by governmental and
self-regulatory organizations in the U.S. and in the other jurisdictions in
which we operate around the world. These regulations are designed to ensure the
integrity of the financial markets and to protect the interests of the people
and entities participating in these markets. Consequently, these regulations
often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer
protection and market conduct requirements. If we were to violate these
regulations, we would face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory
authorities, including extended investigation and surveillance activity,
adoption of costly or restrictive new regulations and judicial or administrative
proceedings that may result in substantial penalties. In addition,
non-compliance with these regulations could have a material adverse financial
effect or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could
seriously harm our business prospects. See ""Item 1. Business - Regulatory and
Compliance Factors Affecting the Company and the Securities Industry"" for a
further discussion of the regulatory environment in which we conduct our
business.

      Our participation in the U.S., Canadian and certain European energy
markets subjects us to legal, regulatory and reputational risks. Our energy
businesses are subject to extensive and evolving federal, regional, state and
local laws, rules and regulations. Intensified scrutiny of the energy markets by
governmental agencies and the public has resulted in an increase in compliance
standards and regulatory reporting requirements, as well as governmental
investigations and audits of energy market participants. An adverse audit or
investigation finding may subject to us to substantial fines and penalties and,
to the extent publicized, may cause significant reputational harm. We may also
incur substantial costs in complying with current or future laws, rules and
regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management,
preservation of natural resources, site remediation and health and safety at or
associated with our ownership interests in or contractual rights to power
generation facilities. We could be required to expend significant amounts of
capital for environmental monitoring, installation of pollution control
equipment, payment of emission fees, and application for, and holding of,
permits and licenses for these power generation facilities.

      We are also subject to risks relating to potential disruptions at any of
the power generation facilities in which we have ownership rights or may
otherwise have contractual rights or obligations. Disruptions may occur for many
reasons, each of which may cause harm to our businesses and reputation. Many of
these disruptions are outside of our control and include the breakdown or
failure of power generation equipment, transmission lines or other equipment or
processes, whether caused by failed or improper maintenance, advanced equipment
age or natural disasters. A contractual failure of performance by third-party
suppliers or service providers, including the failure to obtain and deliver raw
materials necessary for the operation of power generation facilities, may also
cause disruptions. Where the disruption is due to unforeseen or catastrophic
events, including terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other hostile or
catastrophic events, we may not have insurance against these risks or, if we
carry such insurance, the insurance proceeds may be inadequate to cover our
losses. Market conditions or other similar disruption factors could also cause a
failure to satisfy or obtain waivers under agreements with third parties,
including lenders, which impose significant obligations on our subsidiaries that
own or otherwise have contractual rights in power generation facilities. The
occurrence of any of the foregoing events may prevent the affected facilities
from performing under applicable power sales agreements, may impair their
operations or financial results and may result in litigation or reputational
harm to us.

      The financial services industry is intensely competitive. We encounter
intense competition in all aspects of the securities business, particularly
underwriting, trading and advisory services and competes directly with other
securities firms - both domestic and foreign - many having substantially greater
capital and resources and offering a wider range of financial services than do
we. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including transaction
execution, our products and services, innovation, reputation and price. We may
be adversely affected if our current or potential customers and clients decide
to use the financial services of our competitors instead of us.

      Alternative trading systems may adversely affect our business and may
increase competition. Securities and futures transactions are now being
conducted through the internet and other alternative, non-traditional trading
systems, and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading systems will
continue and probably accelerate. Some of these alternative trading systems
compete with our trading businesses, including our specialist businesses, and we
may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas. A
dramatic increase in computer-based or other electronic trading may adversely
affect our commission and trading revenues.

      Changes in business, political and/or economic conditions could have an
adverse effect on us. Our future results could be adversely affected by changes
in business, political and economic conditions, including the cost and
availability of insurance, due to the threat of future terrorist activity in the
U.S. and other parts of the world and related U.S. military action overseas.

      We have complemented and may continue to complement our growth through
acquisitions and joint ventures, which subject us to numerous risks that could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results
of operations. Acquisitions and joint ventures may require significant capital
resources, divert management's attention from our existing business and may not
have the benefits anticipated. Acquisitions and joint ventures also entail
inherent risks and challenges, including but not limited to, difficulty with
system integration, geographic divergence, language integration and the
increasing scope, complexity and diversity of products and operations.
Acquisitions and joint ventures could also subject us to contingent or other
liabilities unknown to us at the time of the acquisition or joint venture. We
may also incur significantly greater expenditures in integrating an acquired
business or joint venture than had been initially anticipated. In addition, our
inability to retain and integrate key personnel in connection with an
acquisition could materially impair the value of an acquired business.

      Managing reputational risk is paramount to the value of our brand. Our
reputation is one of our most important corporate assets, and is critical in
attracting and maintaining customers, investors and employees.

                                      -19-


Threats to a firm's reputation can come from many sources, including, without
limitation, unethical practices, employee misconduct, failing to deliver minimum
standards of service and quality, compliance failures and activities of
customers and affiliates. We have policies and procedures in place to protect
our reputation and promote ethical conduct, but these policies and procedures
may not be fully effective. Negative publicity regarding us, our business,
employees, customers or affiliates, whether or not true, may result in the loss
of customers, employees and investors, costly litigation, a decline in revenues
and increased governmental regulation.

      Employee misconduct is difficult to detect and prevent and may have an
adverse effect on our business. In recent years, there have been a number of
highly publicized cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the
financial services industry, and we run the risk that employee misconduct could
occur. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the
precautions we must take to prevent and detect this activity may not be
effective in all cases.

      The inability to hire and retain qualified employees may adversely affect
our businesses. Our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts
of highly skilled individuals. There is intense competition in the financial
services industry for qualified employees. In addition, we face increasing
competition with businesses outside the financial services industry, such as
hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds, for the most highly
skilled individuals. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable
to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.

      Future events may be different from those anticipated by our management's
assumptions and estimates, which may cause unexpected losses in the future.
Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, we are required to use certain estimates in preparing our
financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine reserves
related to future litigation and the fair value of our financial instruments,
among other items. For certain of our financial instruments, including
distressed debt, non-performing mortgage-related assets, certain mortgage-backed
securities and residual interests, Chapter 13 and other credit card receivables
from individuals, and complex and exotic derivative structures, the fair value
can only be determined based upon internally developed models or methodologies
utilizing significant inputs that are generally less readily observable from
objective sources. Should our determined values for such items prove
substantially inaccurate, we may experience unexpected losses that could be
material.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments.

      None

Item 2.     Properties.

      The Company's executive offices and principal administrative offices
occupy approximately 1.1 million square feet at 383 Madison Avenue, New York,
New York under an operating lease arrangement. At the end of the lease
arrangement, which expires on August 10, 2012, the Company may request a lease
renewal. In the event the lease renewal cannot be negotiated, the Company has
the right to purchase the building for the amount of the then outstanding
indebtedness of the lessor or to arrange for the sale of the property with the
proceeds of the sale being used to satisfy the lessor's debt obligation.

      The Company leases approximately 308,000 square feet of office space at
One MetroTech Center North, Brooklyn, New York, through 2024 for its securities
processing, accounting and clearance operations. The Company also occupies space
at five other locations in New York City with a combined total of approximately
538,000 square feet of space under leases expiring on various dates through the
year 2020. Elsewhere in the U.S. the Company's offices in 34 cities occupy an
aggregate of approximately 1.1 million square feet under leases expiring on
various dates through the year 2019. The Company's fourteen international
offices occupy an aggregate of approximately 311,000 square feet under leases
expiring on various dates through the year 2016.

      The Company owns approximately 65 acres of land in Whippany, New Jersey,
including five buildings comprising an aggregate of approximately 673,000 square
feet. The Company is currently using the facilities on the property to house its
data processing facility and other operations, disaster recovery, compliance,
personnel

                                      -20-


and accounting functions. Approximately 141,000 square feet in one of the
buildings on the property is being leased to an unaffiliated third party under a
15-year operating lease expiring in 2019.

      The Company believes that the facilities it occupies are adequate for the
purposes for which they are currently used and are well maintained.

Item 3.     Legal Proceedings.

      In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are
named as defendants in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class
actions and other litigation. Such actions include those arising out of the
Company's or a subsidiary's activities as a broker and dealer, as an
underwriter, as an investment banker, as an investment advisor, as an employer,
or arising out of alleged employee misconduct. Certain of the legal actions
include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims
for indeterminate amounts of damages. The Company is also involved in other
reviews, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory
agencies regarding the Company's business, certain of which may result in
adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.

      Because litigation is inherently unpredictable, particularly in cases
where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where
investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, the Company cannot
predict with certainty the loss or range of loss related to such matters, how
such matters will be resolved, when they will be ultimately resolved, or what
the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief might be. The Company
cannot estimate losses or ranges of losses for matters where there is only a
reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred. The Company believes,
based upon its current knowledge, after consultation with counsel, that the
resolution of the legal actions, proceedings and investigations currently
pending against it will not have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition of the Company, taken as a whole. However, in the light of the
uncertainties involved in such legal actions, proceedings, and investigations,
the ultimate resolution of these matters cannot be ascertained at this time. As
a result, the resolution of a particular matter may have a material effect on
the Company's operating results and cash flows in any future period, depending
on the level of income for such period.

      The Company has provided reserves for such matters in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, ""Accounting for
Contingencies"". The ultimate resolution may differ from the amounts reserved.

      In re McKesson HBOC, Inc. Securities Litigation: This matter arises out of
a merger between McKesson Corporation (""McKesson"") and HBO & Company (""HBOC"")
resulting in an entity called McKesson HBOC, Inc. (""McKesson HBOC"").

      Beginning on June 29, 1999, 53 purported class actions were commenced in
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. These actions
were subsequently consolidated, and the plaintiffs proceeded to file a series of
amended complaints. On February 15, 2002, the plaintiffs filed a third amended
consolidated complaint, which alleges that Bear Stearns violated Sections 10(b)
and 14(a) of the Exchange Act in connection with allegedly false and misleading
disclosures contained in a joint proxy statement/prospectus that was issued with
respect to the McKesson/HBOC merger.

      Plaintiffs purport to represent a class consisting of all persons who
either (i) acquired publicly traded securities of HBOC between January 20, 1997
and January 12, 1999, or (ii) acquired publicly traded securities of McKesson or
McKesson HBOC between October 18, 1998 and April 27, 1999, and who held McKesson
securities on November 27, 1998 and January 22, 1999. Named defendants include
McKesson HBOC, certain present and former directors and/or officers of McKesson
HBOC, McKesson and/or HBOC, Bear Stearns and Arthur Andersen LLP. Compensatory
damages in an unspecified amount are sought.

      On January 6, 2003, the court granted Bear Stearns' motion to dismiss the
Section 10(b) claim asserted in the third amended complaint, and denied Bear
Stearns' motion to dismiss the Section 14(a) claim. On March 7, 2003, Bear
Stearns filed an answer to the third amended complaint denying all allegations
of wrongdoing and asserting affirmative defenses to the claims in the complaint.
On January 12, 2005, McKesson HBOC announced

                                      -21-


that it had reached a settlement with the plaintiff class, which settlement
required court approval. Bear Stearns' engagement letter with McKesson in
connection with the merger of McKesson and HBOC provides that McKesson cannot
settle any litigation without Bear Stearns' written consent unless McKesson
obtains an unconditional written release for Bear Stearns and, under certain
circumstances, is required to provide indemnification to Bear Stearns.

      By Order dated May 23, 2005, the Court denied preliminary approval of the
proposed settlement between McKesson HBOC and the plaintiff class. On July 12,
2005, the plaintiff and McKesson HBOC submitted a revised proposed settlement,
purporting to address the issues identified by the Court in its order denying
preliminary approval, to which Bear Stearns objected. The revised proposed
settlement provides, among other things, that Bear Stearns' rights under its
engagement letter are preserved for future resolution. McKesson HBOC's claims in
connection with the letter are also preserved.

      On February 24, 2006, the Court granted final approval of the revised
proposed settlement. Bear Stearns appealed the final approval order to the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, seeking to reverse the final
approval of the settlement on the ground that consummation of the settlement may
deprive Bear Stearns of certain rights and remedies provided for in its
engagement letter.

      On December 8, 2005, Bear Stearns commenced a separate action in New York
State Supreme Court, New York County, Bear Stearns v. McKesson Corp. (the ""New
York Action""), asserting breach of contracts and other claims against McKesson
based on the engagement letter and seeking, among other things, declaratory
relief and damages. On April 24, 2006, McKesson moved to dismiss certain causes
of action asserted in the complaint. On October 25, 2006, the Court issued an
opinion denying McKesson's motion to dismiss in part and allowing Bear Stearns
to proceed with certain of its claims.

      On September 24, 2007, the parties in the Federal Class Action entered
into a stipulation of settlement. The stipulation of settlement provides that,
subject to final approval by the District Court, the claims asserted on behalf
of the settlement class against Bear Stearns will be dismissed with prejudice
and that Bear Stearns denies any wrongdoing in connection with the claims
asserted against it in the Federal Class Action. Under the stipulation of
settlement, promptly following preliminary approval of the settlement by the
District Court, Bear Stearns will withdraw its appeal of the District Court's
approval of McKesson's settlement of the Federal Class Action. The District
Court granted preliminary approval on September 28, 2007. Pursuant to the
stipulation of settlement, on October 9, 2007, Bear Stearns withdrew its appeal
in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On January 18, 2008,
the District Court gave final approval to the settlement of the Federal Class
Action and entered a judgment for dismissal. Bear Stearns has agreed to dismiss
its claims against McKesson in the New York Action and Bear Stearns and McKesson
have agreed to exchange mutual releases. Bear Stearns will make no payment in
connection with the settlement.

      Helen Gredd, Chapter 11 Trustee for Manhattan Investment Fund Ltd. v.
Bear, Stearns Securities Corp.: On April 24, 2001, an action was commenced
against BSSC in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York
by the Chapter 11 Trustee for Manhattan Investment Fund Limited (""MIFL""). BSSC
provided prime brokerage services to MIFL prior to its bankruptcy. BSSC is the
sole defendant in this action. The complaint alleges, among other things, that
certain transfers of cash and securities to BSSC in connection with short sales
of securities by MIFL in 1999 were ""fraudulent transfers"" made in violation of
Sections 548 and 550 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and are recoverable by the
Trustee. The Trustee also alleges that any claim that may be asserted by BSSC
against MIFL should be equitably subordinated to the claims of other creditors
pursuant to Sections 105 and 510 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Trustee seeks to
recover in excess of $1.9 billion in connection with the allegedly fraudulent
transfers to BSSC.

      On March 21, 2002, the District Court dismissed the trustee's claims
seeking to recover allegedly fraudulent transfers in amounts exceeding $1.9
billion. The District Court also remanded to the Bankruptcy Court the Trustee's
remaining claims, which seek to recover allegedly fraudulent transfers in the
amount of $141.4 million plus pre-judgment interest and to equitably subordinate
any claim that may be asserted by BSSC against MIFL to the claims of other
creditors.

                                      -22-


      On October 17, 2002, BSSC filed an answer to the complaint in which it
denied all allegations of wrongdoing and asserted affirmative defenses.

      By Order and Decision dated January 9, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court ruled on
the parties' cross motions for summary judgment. The Court denied BSSC's motion
for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the Trustee's complaint in its
entirety and granted the Trustee's motion for summary judgment on the fraudulent
transfer claims against BSSC. BSSC believes it has substantial defenses to the
Trustee's claims and appealed the Bankruptcy Court's decision to the U.S.
District for the Southern District of New York.

      On appeal, the District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's findings in
part, but also reversed in part, the Bankruptcy's Court's grant of summary
judgment to the Trustee, finding that a trial is necessary to make a factual
finding as to whether BSSC acted in good faith with respect to its receipt of
the alleged fraudulent transfers.

      Enron Corp., et ano. v. Bear, Stearns International Ltd., et ano.: On
November 25, 2003, BSIL and BSSC were named as defendants in an adversary
proceeding commenced by Enron and Enron North America Corp. in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Plaintiffs seek, inter
alia, to recover payments, totaling approximately $26 million that were
allegedly made to BSIL and BSSC during August 2001 in connection with an equity
derivative contract between BSIL and Enron. According to the complaint, Enron's
payments constituted (a) fraudulent transfers, under Section 548(a) of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code and under applicable state law and (b) an unlawful redemption of
Enron common stock in violation of Oregon law. Enron seeks judgment (a) avoiding
and setting aside Enron's August 2001 payments to BSIL and BSSC, (b) directing
BSIL and BSSC to pay Enron approximately $26 million, plus prejudgment interest,
(c) declaring that Enron's August 2001 payments violated Oregon law, (d)
disallowing any claims by BSIL and BSSC in connection with Enron's bankruptcy
proceedings until they have returned the August 2001 payments to Enron and (e)
awarding Enron its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection
with the action.

      By Order dated June 3, 2005, the Bankruptcy Court had denied the motion to
dismiss filed by BSIL and BSSC. Defendants filed a motion with the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York for leave to take an interlocutory
appeal from the Bankruptcy Court's decision. By Order dated May 2, 2006, the
District Court denied defendants' motion for leave to take an interlocutory
appeal from the Bankruptcy Court's decision.

      The parties reached a mutual agreement to settle this proceeding. By Order
dated December 3, 2007, the Bankruptcy Court approved the terms of the parties'
settlement.

      IPO Allocation Securities and Antitrust Litigations

      The Company and Bear Stearns (the ""Bear Stearns defendants""), along with
many other financial services firms, have been named as defendants in many
putative class actions filed during 2001 and 2002 in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York involving the allocation of securities in
certain initial public offerings (""IPOs""). The complaints in these purported
class actions generally allege, among other things, that between 1998 and 2000:
(i) the underwriters of certain ""hot"" IPOs of technology and internet-related
companies obtained excessive compensation by allocating shares in these IPOs to
preferred customers who, in return, purportedly agreed to pay additional
compensation to the underwriters, and the underwriters failed to disclose this
additional compensation and/or (ii) the underwriters' customers, in return for a
favorable allocation of these securities, agreed to purchase additional shares
in the aftermarket at pre-arranged prices or to pay additional compensation in
connection with other transactions.

      Beginning on April 19, 2002, the plaintiffs in these litigations filed
amended complaints by virtue of which the public offerings of each of the 309
issuers are now the subjects of separate complaints. The Bear Stearns defendants
are defendants in 95 of these amended complaints. As amended, the complaints
allege, among other things, that the underwriters, including Bear Stearns,
violated Section 11 of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, based on the wrongdoing alleged in the
original complaints and by causing their securities analysts to issue
unwarranted positive reports regarding the issuers. Compensatory damages in
unspecified amounts are sought.

                                      -23-


      By order dated October 13, 2004, the Court granted in part and denied in
part class certification for each of the six cases selected to be the focus
cases for these proceedings.

      By opinion and order dated February 15, 2005, the Court preliminarily
approved the proposed settlement among plaintiffs and a substantial number of
the non-bankrupt issuer defendants and their officers and directors. The
settlement generally provided that (1) the insurers of these issuers will
guarantee an ultimate recovery by plaintiffs, in this and related litigations,
of $1 billion; (2) these issuers will assign to plaintiffs so-called ""excess
compensation"" claims against the underwriter defendants, including the Bear
Stearns defendants, that these issuers allegedly possess; and (3) plaintiffs
will, upon final approval of the settlement, dismiss all claims against these
issuers and the individual director and officer defendants. That preliminary
approval, however, was conditioned upon certain changes being made to the terms
of the settlement.

      On December 5, 2006, the Second Circuit vacated the lower court's class
certification of the six selected focus cases. The Second Circuit concluded that
class certification of these cases was improper and remanded the cases to the
lower court for further proceedings.

      In January 2002, Bear Stearns was named as a defendant, along with nine
other financial services firms, in an antitrust complaint filed in the same
court on behalf of a putative class of purchasers who, either in IPOs or in the
aftermarket, purchased technology-related securities during the period March
1997 to December 2000. The Plaintiffs allege that the defendants conspired to
require that customers, in return for an allocation in the IPOs, (i) pay charges
in addition to the IPO price, such as non-competitively determined commissions
on the purchase or sale of other securities and/or (ii) agree to purchase the
IPO securities in the aftermarket at prices above the IPO price. Plaintiffs
claim that these alleged practices violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act and
state antitrust laws and seek compensatory and treble damages. On November 6,
2003, the District Court granted the defendants' (including Bear Stearns')
motion to dismiss all claims asserted against them by these antitrust
plaintiffs. The plaintiffs appealed that decision to the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals and on September 28, 2005, the Court of Appeals vacated the dismissal
and remanded this matter to the lower court for further proceedings.

      On December 7, 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court granted defendants' petition
for certiorari to appeal the decision issued by the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals. On June 18, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit
Court of Appeals' decision.

      The Company denies all allegations of wrongdoing asserted against it in
these litigations and believes that it has substantial defenses to these claims.

      IPO Underwriting Fee Antitrust Litigation: Bear Stearns, along with
numerous other financial services firms, is a defendant in several consolidated
class actions currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. The first consolidated action, filed on March 15, 2001,
purports to be brought on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of stock in
initial public offerings (the ""Purchaser Action""). The second consolidated
action, filed on July 6, 2001, purports to be brought on behalf of a putative
class of issuers of stock in initial public offerings (the ""Issuer Action"").
Each suit alleges that Bear Stearns violated federal antitrust laws by fixing
underwriting fees at 7% for initial public offerings with an aggregate issuance
value of $20-$80 million for the time period 1994 to the present. The plaintiff
in each action seeks injunctive relief and treble damages.

      On February 24, 2004, the District Court granted defendants' motion to
dismiss the complaint in the Purchaser Action in part, dismissing plaintiffs'
claim for treble damages under Section 4 of the Clayton Act. However, the Court
denied defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' claim for injunctive
relief.

      On September 16, 2004, plaintiffs in the Purchaser Action and the Issuer
Action moved for class certification. On October 25, 2005, plaintiffs in both
actions moved for partial summary judgment against defendants on liability.

      By Order dated April 18, 2006, the District Court denied the Issuer
plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The Issuer plaintiffs appealed the
District Court's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. By
Order dated September 11, 2007, the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's
denial of

                                      -24-


class certification and remanded the matter back to the District Court for
further consideration of certain questions specified in the Second Circuit's
Order.

      Bear Stearns has denied all allegations of wrongdoing asserted against it
in these litigations and believes that it has substantial defenses to these
claims.

      Mutual Fund Litigation

      On November 7, 2003, BSSC, the Company and Bear Stearns (the ""Bear Stearns
defendants""), together with 18 other entities and individuals, were named as
defendants in a purported class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York by a mutual fund investor on behalf of persons
who purchased and/or sold ownership units of mutual funds in the Janus or Putnam
families of mutual funds between November 1, 1998 and July 3, 2003. On January
26, 2004, plaintiff filed a first amended complaint, again on behalf of persons
who traded in the Janus or Putnam families of mutual funds, against the same
Bear Stearns defendants and 16 other entities and individuals, including mutual
funds and other financial institutions. On October 22, 2003, another purported
class action was filed on behalf of the general public of the State of
California against multiple defendants, and subsequently included the Company as
a defendant, with respect to various mutual funds. Both of these actions allege
that the defendants violated federal and/or state laws by allowing certain
investors to market time and/or late trade mutual fund shares and seek various
forms of relief including damages of an indeterminate amount. On March 19, 2004,
these actions were transferred to the District of Maryland for coordinated
and/or consolidated pre-trial proceedings as part of MDL 1586-In re: Mutual
Funds Investment Litigation.

      On or subsequent to September 29, 2004, fifteen new and/or amended class
action or derivative complaints were filed in MDL-1586 naming as defendants the
Bear Stearns defendants, various mutual fund companies, certain broker-dealers,
and others (collectively the ""defendants""). Plaintiffs who have brought actions,
either directly or derivatively, against one or more of the Bear Stearns
defendants are shareholders in the following families of mutual funds: AIM,
Invesco, PIMCO/Allianz Dresdner, Excelsior, Alliance, Franklin Templeton, One
Group, Strong, Columbia, Pilgrim Baxter, Alger, Janus, RS and MFS. Among other
things, the actions allege that the defendants violated federal and/or state
laws by allowing certain investors to market time and/or late trade mutual fund
shares and seek various forms of relief including damages of an indeterminate
amount.

      The Bear Stearns defendants, along with certain other defendants, filed an
omnibus motion to dismiss the consolidated class action and derivative claims
against them. On November 3, 2005, the derivative claims against the Bear
Stearns defendants were dismissed. As of December 31, 2005, the Bear Stearns
defendants' motion to dismiss was otherwise granted in part and denied in part
as to direct investor claims in the following families of mutual funds: Janus,
AIM/Invesco, RS, One Group, MFS, Columbia, PIMCO/Allianz Dresdner, Alger,
Excelsior and Strong.

      The Bear Stearns defendants believe that they have substantial defenses to
the remaining claims.

      Bear Wagner Specialists LLC: Bear Wagner Specialists LLC, a subsidiary of
the Company, is among numerous defendants named in purported class actions
brought on behalf of investors beginning in October 2003 in the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York alleging violations of the federal
securities laws in connection with NYSE floor specialist activities. The actions
seek unspecified compensatory damages, restitution, and disgorgement on behalf
of purchasers and sellers of unspecified securities between October 17, 1998 and
October 15, 2003. Bear Wagner Specialists LLC and the Company are also among the
defendants in a purported class action filed in December 2003 in California
Superior Court, Los Angeles County alleging violation of California law in
connection with the same conduct. This case was transferred to the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York. The district court consolidated
these purported class actions under the caption In re NYSE Specialists
Securities Litigation, No. 03 Civ. 8264 (RWS). On September 15, 2004, a

      In re Prime Hospitality, Inc. Shareholders Litigation: On July 15, 2005,
plaintiff shareholders of Prime Hospitality Corporation (""Prime"") filed a
consolidated amended class action complaint in the Delaware Chancery Court
against the directors of Prime, the Blackstone Group (""Blackstone"") and certain
affiliates of Blackstone, and Bear Stearns. As amended, the complaint alleges
that Bear Stearns acted as financial advisor to Prime in connection with the
sale of Prime to Blackstone, and that Bear Stearns aided and abetted a breach of
fiduciary duty by the directors of Prime in connection with that transaction.
The amended complaint seeks from defendants compensatory damages in an
unspecified amount, as well as various forms of equitable relief, including, but
not limited to, rescissory damages, the imposition of a constructive trust and
an accounting. On October 3, 2005, Bear Stearns filed its answer to the
consolidated amended class action complaint denying all allegations of
wrongdoing and asserted affirmative defenses.

      The parties reached an agreement in principle to settle the action against
all defendants, including Bear Stearns. On September 19, 2007, the Court
approved the settlement and the case was dismissed with prejudice. Pursuant to
the settlement, Bear Stearns was not required to make any payments, and obtained
a full release of all claims that were asserted against it.

      Short Selling Litigation

      The Company, along with numerous other financial services firms, was named
as a defendant in a purported class action filed in the U.S. District Court for
the Southern District of New York by customers who engaged in short-selling
transactions in equity securities since April 12, 2000. The complaint generally
alleged that the customers were charged fees in connection with the short sales
but that the applicable securities were not necessarily borrowed to effect
delivery, which resulted in failed deliveries of the securities and/or excess
charges to the customers. The complaint alleged that this conduct constituted a
conspiracy in violation of the federal antitrust laws, and also asserts New York
state-law claims.

      Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on March 15, 2007. On December
20, 2007, the District Court dismissed the complaint in its entirety, dismissing
the federal antitrust claims with prejudice, and the state-law claims without
prejudice, as to all defendants, and directing that the case be closed.

      BSSC, along with numerous other financial securities firms and other
unnamed persons, has been named as a defendant in two separate actions in
California state court. The complaints generally allege that since late 2004,
the defendants have engaged in a market-manipulation scheme in their role as
prime brokers, involving the alleged intentional failure to deliver securities
to cover short sales. The complaints further allege that such failures to
deliver distorted the market for, and artificially depressed the share price of,
the securities identified in the respective complaints. The complaints allege
causes of action under California statutory and common law.

      BSSC believes it has substantial defenses to the claims brought in these
actions.

      Mortgage-Related Matters

      The Company has received requests for information from various regulatory
and governmental entities relating to subprime mortgages, mortgage
securitizations, collateralized debt obligations, and synthetic products related
to subprime mortgages. The Company is cooperating with the requests.

      BSAM-Managed Hedge Fund Matters

      The Company, Bear Stearns, BSAM, BSSC and/or certain individual current or
former employees have been named as defendants in two purported class action
complaints relating to the Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies
Master Fund, Ltd. (the ""High Grade Fund"") and the Bear Stearns High Grade
Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Master Fund, Ltd. (the ""Enhanced
Leverage Fund""). BSAM served as investment manager for both of these funds.

      The first action, titled Navigator Capital Partners, L.P. v. BSAM, et al.,
was filed on August 6, 2007 in New York State Supreme Court. The action is
styled as both a purported class action on behalf of purchasers of partnership
interests in Bear Stearns High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Fund, L.P.
(the ""HG Partnership""), also known as a ""feeder fund,"" which invested
substantially all of its assets in the High Grade Fund, as well as a derivative
action on behalf of the HG Partnership as a nominal defendant. The Complaint
asserts claims for breaches of fiduciary duty against BSAM and the individual
defendants. The remaining defendants are alleged to have aided and abetted in
the breaches of fiduciary duty. The named plaintiff in this action alleges that
it purchased in excess of $700,000 of Partnership interests. The relief being
sought by the plaintiff is unspecified damages, costs and fees.

                                      -26-


      The second action, titled FIC, L.P. v. BSAM, et al., was filed on December
21, 2007 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The
action was brought by a purchaser of partnership interests in the Bear Stearns
High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund, L.P., also known
as a ""feeder fund,"" which invested substantially all its assets synthetically
through a leverage instrument to conduct activities indirectly through an
investment in the Enhanced Leverage Fund. The Complaint asserts claims for
breach of contract and breaches of fiduciary duty against BSAM and the
individual defendants. The remaining defendants are charged with having aided
and abetted in the breaches of fiduciary duty. The relief being sought by the
plaintiff is unspecified damages, costs and fees.

      Also, the Company, Bear Stearns, BSAM, and certain individual employees
have been named as defendants in an action filed by Barclays Bank PLC
(""Barclays"") on December 20, 2007 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern
District of New York. The complaint asserts claims for, among other things,
fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and negligent misrepresentation for the conduct
of defendants relating to the Enhanced Leverage Fund, and transactions Barclays
entered into with the feeder funds of the Enhanced Leverage Fund. The relief
being sought by Barclays is unspecified compensatory and punitive damages,
costs, and fees.

      In addition, one or more of Bear Stearns, BSAM, BSSC, and/or certain
individual current or former employees have been named as respondents in
multiple FINRA arbitrations related to investments in feeder funds of the High
Grade Fund and/or the Enhanced Leverage Fund. The relief being sought by the
claimants in these arbitrations is compensatory damages, unspecified punitive
damages, costs and expenses.

      The Company believes it has substantial defenses to claims asserted
against it in these proceedings.

      The Company has also been contacted by and received requests for
information and documents from various federal and state regulatory and law
enforcement authorities regarding the High Grade Fund and the Enhanced Leverage
Fund, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the U.S. Attorney's
Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Securities Division of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the ""Securities Division""). On November 14, 2007,
the Securities Division filed an administrative complaint against BSAM alleging
that BSAM violated multiple provisions of the Massachusetts Securities Act by
failing to adequately disclose and/or manage conflicts of interest related to
procedures for related party transactions.

      (1) On December 13, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Company approved
an amendment to the Stock Repurchase Program (""Repurchase Program"") to replenish
the previous authorization in order to allow the Company to purchase up to $2.0
billion of common stock in fiscal 2007 and beyond. In addition, on September 18,
2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to the
Repurchase Program authorizing the purchase of up to $2.5 billion of common
stock in fiscal 2007 and beyond. This amendment supersedes the previous $2.0
billion authorization. During the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007, the
Company purchased under the current and prior authorizations approximately 11.9
million shares at a cost of approximately $1.6 billion of which 3.4 million
shares at a cost of $374 million were purchased pursuant to corporate share
repurchases. Approximately $2.1 billion was available to be purchased under the
current authorization as of November 30, 2007. The Repurchase Program will be
used to acquire both shares of common stock for the Company's employee stock
award plans and for up to $1.0 billion in corporate share repurchases. The
Company expects to utilize the repurchase authorization to offset the dilutive
impact of annual share awards. Purchases may be made in the open market or
through privately negotiated transactions. The Company may, depending on price
and other factors, repurchase additional shares in excess of that required for
annual share awards.

      During the fiscal year ended November 30, 2007, the Company also purchased
711,557 shares of its common stock at a total cost of $108 million pursuant to a
$200 million amendment to the CAP Plan Earnings Purchase Authorization, which
was approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company on December 12, 2006. Approximately $92 million of this authorization is
remaining for future repurchases as of November 30, 2007.

      The repurchase programs have no set expiration or termination date.

                    NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

1.    General

      The condensed financial information of the Company (Parent Company Only)
      should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements
      of The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. and subsidiaries and the Notes thereto
      in The Bear Stearns Companies Inc. 2007 Annual Report to Stockholders (the
      ""Annual Report"") incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.

      The condensed unconsolidated financial statements are prepared in
      conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
      States of America which require management to make certain estimates and
      assumptions, including those regarding fair value measurements,
      stock-based compensation, certain accrued liabilities and the potential
      outcome of litigation and tax matters, which may affect the amounts
      reported in the condensed unconsolidated financial statements and
      accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these
      estimates.

      Investments in wholly owned or other subsidiaries are accounted for using
      the equity method.

      For information on the following, refer to the indicated Notes to the
      Consolidated Financial Statements within the Annual Report.

      o     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Note 1)
      o     Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Note 2)
      o     Financial Instruments (Note 3)

      o     Commitments and Contingencies (Note 17)

      The Company engages in derivatives activities in order to modify the
      interest rate characteristics of its long and short-term debt. See
      ""Hedging Activity"" section of Note 4, ""Derivatives and Hedging
      Activities"", to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual
      Report.

2.    Statement of Cash Flows

      Income taxes paid, net of refunds (consolidated) totaled approximately
      $561 million, $709 million and $146 million for the fiscal years ended
      November 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash payments for income
      taxes, net of refunds, would have been approximately $815 million, $1.1
      billion and $572 million for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2007,
      2006 and 2005, respectively, if increases in the value of equity
      instruments issued under share-based payment arrangements had not been
      deductible in determining taxable income. Cash payments for interest
      approximated interest expense for each of the periods presented.

Managements Discussion
    and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations




 










   Forward-Looking
    Statements and Non-GAAP Financial Measures
    




    We have included certain statements in this report which may be
    considered forward-looking, including those about management
    expectations, strategic objectives, growth opportunities,
    business prospects, anticipated financial results, the impact of
    off-balance sheet exposures, significant contractual
    obligations, anticipated results of litigation and regulatory
    investigations and proceedings, risk management policies and
    other similar matters. These forward-looking statements
    represent only Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.s
    (ML & Co. and, together with its
    subsidiaries, Merrill Lynch, the
    company, we, our or
    us) beliefs regarding future performance, which is
    inherently uncertain. There are a variety of factors, many of
    which are beyond our control, which affect our operations,
    performance, business strategy and results and could cause our
    actual results and experience to differ materially from the
    expectations and objectives expressed in any forward-looking
    statements. These factors include, but are not limited to,
    actions and initiatives taken by both current and potential
    competitors and counterparties, general economic conditions,
    market conditions, the effects of current, pending and future
    legislation, regulation and regulatory actions, the actions of
    rating agencies and the other risks and uncertainties detailed
    in this report. See Risk Factors that Could Affect Our
    Business. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place
    undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only
    as of the dates on which they are made. We do not undertake to
    update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of
    circumstances or events that arise after the dates they are
    made. The reader should, however, consult further disclosures we
    may make in future filings of our Annual Report on
    Form 10-K,
    Quarterly Reports on
    Form 10-Q
    and Current Reports on
    Form 8-K.

 

    From time to time, we may also disclose financial information on
    a non-GAAP basis where management uses this information and
    believes this information will be valuable to investors in
    gauging the quality of our financial performance, identifying
    trends in our results and providing more meaningful
    period-to-period comparisons. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP
    measures presented throughout this report see Exhibit 99.1
    filed with our 2007 Form 10-K.

   Introduction




    Merrill Lynch was formed in 1914 and became a publicly traded
    company on June 23, 1971. In 1973, we created the holding
    company, ML & Co., a Delaware corporation that,
    through its subsidiaries, is one of the worlds leading
    capital markets, advisory and wealth management companies with
    offices in 40 countries and territories and total client assets
    of almost $2 trillion at December 28, 2007. As an
    investment bank, we are a leading global trader and underwriter
    of securities and derivatives across a broad range of asset
    classes, and we serve as a strategic advisor to corporations,
    governments, institutions and individuals worldwide. In
    addition, we own a 45% voting interest and approximately half of
    the economic interest of BlackRock, Inc.
    (BlackRock), one of the worlds largest
    publicly traded investment management companies with
    approximately $1.4 trillion in assets under management at
    December 28, 2007.

 

    Since the fourth quarter of 2006, our business segment reporting
    reflects the management reporting lines established after the
    merger of our Merrill Lynch Investment Managers
    (MLIM) business with BlackRock on September 29,
    2006 (the BlackRock merger).

Table of Contents


    Prior to the fourth quarter of 2006, we reported our business
    activities in three business segments: Global Markets and
    Investment Banking (GMI), Global Private Client
    (GPC), and MLIM. Effective with the BlackRock
    merger, MLIM ceased to exist as a separate business segment. As
    a result, a new business segment, Global Wealth Management
    (GWM), was created, consisting of GPC and Global
    Investment Management (GIM). GWM and GMI are now our
    business segments. We have restated prior period segment
    information to conform to the current period presentation and,
    as a result, are presenting GWM as if it had existed for these
    prior periods. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information on segments, and see
    Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information on the BlackRock merger.

    We also provide a variety of research services on a global basis
    through Global Research. These services are at the core of the
    value proposition we offer to institutional and individual
    investor clients and are an integral component of the product
    offerings to GMI and GWM. This group distributes research
    focusing on four main disciplines globally: fundamental equity
    research, fixed income and equity-linked research, economics and
    foreign exchange research and investment strategy research. We
    consistently rank among the leading research providers in the
    industry, and our analysts and other professionals cover
    approximately 3,600 companies.

 

    We are a Consolidated Supervised Entity (CSE) and
    subject to group-wide supervision by the SEC. As a CSE, we
    compute allowable capital and allowances and permit the SEC to
    examine the books and records of the holding company and of any
    subsidiary that does not have a principal regulator. We have
    also adopted SEC reporting, record-keeping, and notification
    requirements. We were in compliance with applicable CSE
    standards as of December 28, 2007. In respect of the
    European Union (EU) Financial Conglomerates (or
    Financial Groups) Directive, the U.K. Financial
    Services Authority (FSA) has determined that the SEC
    undertakes equivalent consolidated supervision for Merrill Lynch.

   Executive
    Overview



 










   Company
    Results
    




    We reported a net loss from continuing operations for 2007 of
    $8.6 billion, or $10.73 loss per diluted share, compared to
    net earnings from continuing operations of $7.1 billion, or
    $7.17 per diluted share for 2006. Net revenues for 2007 were
    $11.3 billion, down 67% from $33.8 billion in 2006,
    while the 2007 pre-tax loss from continuing operations was
    $12.8 billion compared to pre-tax earnings from continuing
    operations of $9.8 billion for 2006.

 

    Our substantially reduced performance during the year was
    primarily driven by significant declines in Fixed Income,
    Currencies & Commodities (FICC) net
    revenues for the second half of the year, which more than offset
    record full year net revenues in Equity Markets, Investment
    Banking and GPC, and record first half net revenues from FICC.
    During the second half of 2007, FICC net revenues were
    materially impacted by a weaker business environment which
    resulted in full year net write-downs that included
    approximately $23.2 billion related to
    U.S. collateralized debt obligations (CDOs)
    comprised of asset-backed securities (ABS CDOs),
    U.S. sub-prime residential mortgages and securities, and
    credit valuation adjustments related to hedges with financial
    guarantors on U.S. ABS CDOs.

 










   Global
    Markets and Investment Banking (GMI)
    




    GMI recorded negative net revenues of $2.7 billion and a
    pre-tax loss of $16.3 billion for 2007, primarily due to
    net losses in FICC, partially offset by record net revenues from
    Equity Markets and Investment Banking. GMIs net revenues
    also included gains of approximately $1.9 billion
    (approximately $1.2 billion in FICC and $700 million
    in Equity Markets) due to the impact of the widening of Merrill
    Lynchs credit spreads on the carrying value of certain of
    our long-term debt liabilities. Net revenues from GMIs
    three major business lines were as follows:

 

FICC net revenues were negative $15.9 billion for
    2007, impacted primarily by net write-downs of
    $16.7 billion related to U.S. ABS CDOs, write-downs of
    $3.2 billion related to U.S. sub-prime residential
    mortgage exposures, credit valuation adjustments of
    $2.6 billion related to our hedges with financial
    guarantors on U.S. ABS CDOs and write-downs of
    approximately $700 million related to sub-prime related
    securities in our U.S. banks investment securities
    portfolio. To a lesser extent, FICC was impacted by write-downs
    related to other residential mortgage and commercial real estate
    exposures and liabilities recorded for probable losses of
    non-investment grade lending commitments. In addition, the
    business environment for FICC became more challenging towards
    the end of 2007, and resulted in substantially reduced client
    flows and decreased trading opportunities.

 

Equity Markets net revenues for 2007 were a record
    $8.3 billion, up 23% from 2006, driven by strong trading
    volumes in our cash equities platform where we achieved a market
    leading position in U.S. and London Stock Exchange listed
    stocks. Full year results were also driven by strength in
    equity-linked trading and the financing and services businesses.
    These increases in net revenues for the year more than offset a
    year-over-year decline in net revenues from our private equity
    business.

 

Investment Banking net revenues for 2007 were a record
    $4.9 billion, up 22% from the prior year. This reflects
    substantial growth in net revenues for both our equity
    origination and strategic advisory businesses, which increased
    34% and 58% respectively, and the momentum in our global
    origination franchise, as evidenced by our role as sole advisor
    to the consortium including Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis and
    Banco Santander on their landmark acquisition of ABN AMRO. These
    increases in net revenues for equity origination and strategic
    advisory services were partially offset by a decline of 9% in
    debt origination revenues which were impacted by the difficult
    credit markets.

 










   Global
    Wealth Management (GWM)
    




    GWM continued to generate robust net revenues and pre-tax
    earnings in 2007, reflecting continued strong growth in GPC,
    which set numerous records, and GIM, which includes earnings
    from our investment in BlackRock. For 2007, GWMs net
    revenues increased 18% to $14.0 billion, driven by both GPC
    and GIM. Pre-tax earnings increased 59% from the prior year to
    $3.6 billion, and GWMs 2007 pre-tax profit margin was
    25.9%, up 6.6 percentage points from 19.3% in the
    prior-year. Net revenues from GWMs major business lines
    were as follows:

 

GPC net revenues for 2007 were a record
    $12.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with revenue growth
    across all major product lines. Fee-based revenues rose
    significantly reflecting higher market values and strong flows
    into fee-based products, and transaction and origination
    revenues grew strongly driven by higher client transaction
    volumes, particularly outside the United States, and growth in
    origination activity across all products. Net interest profit
    rose as well, reflecting increased revenues from U.S. bank
    deposits and the results of First Republic Bank (First
    Republic), which we acquired on September 21, 2007.

 

GIM net revenues for 2007 were $1.1 billion, up 107%
    from 2006, driven by the inclusion of a full years revenue
    from the investment in BlackRock, as well as strong growth in
    GIMs alternative investments business and strategic
    holdings in investment management companies.

   Capital
    Transactions
    




    As a result of the decrease in our equity capital due to the
    large write-downs we incurred in 2007, one of our key priorities
    towards the end of the year and continuing into the start of
    2008 has been to focus on capital management which has led to
    the following stock issuances:

 






     

    Issuance of 80 million shares of common stock for
    $3.8 billion during the fourth quarter of 2007 in
    connection with equity investments from Temasek Capital
    (Private) Limited (Temasek) and Davis Selected
    Advisors LP (Davis);


 

     

    Issuance of 49.2 million shares of common stock for
    $2.4 billion during the first quarter of 2008 in connection
    with equity investments from Temasek and assignees; and


 

     

    Issuance of $6.6 billion of mandatory convertible preferred
    stock (convertible into a maximum of 126 million shares of
    common stock) during the first quarter of 2008 to long-term
    investors including the Korea Investment Corporation, Kuwait
    Investment Authority and Mizuho Corporate Bank.



 










   Strategic
    Transactions
    




    During 2007 we executed the following strategic transactions:

 

Merrill Lynch
    Insurance Group


    On August 13, 2007, we announced a strategic business
    relationship with AEGON, N.V. (AEGON) in the areas
    of insurance and investment products. As part of this
    relationship, we agreed to sell Merrill Lynch Life Insurance
    Company and ML Life Insurance Company of New York (together
    Merrill Lynch Insurance Group or MLIG)
    to AEGON for $1.3 billion. We will continue to serve the
    insurance needs of our clients through our core distribution and
    advisory capabilities. The sale of MLIG was completed in the
    fourth quarter of 2007 and resulted in an after-tax gain of
    $316 million. The gain along with the results of MLIG have
    been reported within discontinued operations for all periods
    presented. We previously reported the results of MLIG in the GWM
    business segment. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information.

 

First Republic
    Bank


    On September 21, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding
    common shares of First Republic in exchange for a combination of
    cash and stock for a total transaction value of
    $1.8 billion. First Republic provides personalized,
    relationship-based banking services, including private banking,
    private business banking, real estate lending, trust, brokerage
    and investment management. The results of operations of First
    Republic have been included in GWM since the transaction closed.
    Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information.

 

Merrill Lynch
    Capital


    On December 24, 2007, we announced that we had reached an
    agreement with GE Capital to sell Merrill Lynch Capital, a
    wholly-owned middle-market commercial finance business. The sale
    includes substantially all of Merrill Lynch Capitals
    operations, including its commercial real estate division. This
    transaction closed on February 4, 2008. We have included
    the results of Merrill Lynch Capital within discontinued
    operations for all periods presented. We previously reported
    results of Merrill Lynch Capital in the GMI business segment.
    Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information.

 

    As a result of the MLIG and Merrill Lynch Capital transactions
    we will be able to more effectively reallocate capital among our
    businesses.

   Outlook
    




    The challenging market conditions at the end of 2007 have
    continued into 2008, driven largely by significant weakness in
    the U.S. and European credit markets, which we expect to persist
    in the near term with continued asset repricing and valuation
    pressures across multiple asset classes. This continued weakness
    may negatively impact the valuation of our net exposures to
    U.S. super senior ABS CDOs, sub-prime related assets and
    other residential and commercial real estate related loans and
    securities, which would result in additional write-downs.
    Certain of these assets are held by our U.S. banks in their
    investment portfolio and are classified as available-for-sale
    securities. Current market conditions may also result in
    additional write-downs to the carrying amount of our investment
    portfolio. Additionally, negative economic conditions have begun
    to adversely impact other consumer lending asset classes.

 

    Specifically, we ended 2007 with sizeable long and short
    exposures to U.S. ABS CDOs as well as exposure to various
    residential real estate assets including U.S. sub-prime,
    U.S. Alt A, U.S. prime and
    non-U.S. residential
    loans and securities. See the U.S. ABS CDO and Other
    Mortgage-Related Activities section on pages 34 to 38 for
    descriptions and additional information on these net exposures.

 

    To economically hedge certain of our ABS CDO and
    U.S. sub-prime mortgage exposures, we entered into credit
    default swaps with various counterparties, including financial
    guarantors. At December 28, 2007, our short exposure from
    credit default swaps with financial guarantors to economically
    hedge certain U.S. super senior ABS CDOs was
    $13.8 billion, which represented credit default swaps with
    a notional amount of $19.9 billion that have been adjusted
    for mark-to-market gains of $6.1 billion. The fair value of
    these credit default swaps at December 28, 2007 was
    $3.5 billion, after taking into account a $2.6 billion
    credit valuation adjustment related to certain financial
    guarantors. We also have credit derivatives with financial
    guarantors across other referenced assets. The fair value of
    these credit derivatives at December 28, 2007 was
    $2.0 billion, after taking into account a $0.5 billion
    credit valuation adjustment.

 

    Subsequent to year-end, market conditions deteriorated and have
    led to negative rating agency actions for certain financial
    guarantors. We continue to monitor industry and company specific
    developments. Further credit deterioration of the underlying
    assets hedged with the financial guarantors
    and/or the
    financial guarantors themselves could have an adverse impact on
    our future financial performance.

 

    Conditions in both the Leveraged Finance and Commercial Real
    Estate markets, which began to deteriorate in the middle of
    2007, have continued to experience significant spread widening
    and price declines since the beginning of 2008. While difficult
    to predict, future market conditions will likely remain
    challenged due to increased volatility, uncertain economic
    conditions, overhang of the supply of certain large transactions
    that have not yet been successfully syndicated, and reduced
    demand from some market participants. Merrill Lynch continues to
    aggressively focus on reducing its aggregate exposures,
    monitoring the underlying fundamentals of these positions and
    exercising prudent underwriting discipline with respect to any
    new financing commitments.

 

    Overall, with these challenging credit conditions and declines
    in most global equity indices in 2008, volatility in the
    financial markets remains high, and capital markets uncertainty
    has increased. While these factors may negatively impact
    investment banking activity and GWM asset values in the near
    term, we expect certain FICC and Equity Markets businesses to
    benefit from increased client trading activity and proprietary
    trading opportunities. In addition, despite this near-term
    uncertainty, client interest in various strategic and financial
    transactions remains active globally, and investment banking
    pipelines continue to be at healthy levels.

 

    For the long-term, we continue to be optimistic about the
    outlook for our businesses. We expect global GDP growth to
    remain strong, particularly in emerging markets such as Brazil,
    China, India and the Middle East, which we expect to offset
    potentially slowing growth in the U.S. and certain other
    mature economies. Given our regional and product
    diversification, we expect continued growth of the global
    capital markets and ongoing wealth creation around the world to
    provide a favorable environment for our businesses over the
    long-term.

 










   Risk
    Factors that Could Affect Our Business




    In the course of conducting our business operations, we are
    exposed to a variety of risks that are inherent to the financial
    services industry. A summary of some of the significant risks
    that could affect our financial condition and results of
    operations is included below. Some of these risks are managed in
    accordance with established risk management policies and
    procedures, most of which are described in the Risk Management
    section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations
    (MD&A).

 










   Market
    Risk
    




Our business may be adversely impacted by global market and
    economic conditions that may cause fluctuations in interest
    rates, exchange rates, equity and commodity prices and credit
    spreads. We are exposed to potential changes in the value of
    financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates,
    currency exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
    spreads,
    and/or other
    risks. These fluctuations may result from changes in economic
    conditions, investor sentiment, monetary and fiscal policies,
    the liquidity of global markets, availability and cost of
    capital, the actions of credit rating agencies, international
    and regional political events, and acts of war or terrorism. We
    have large proprietary trading and investment positions, which
    include positions in fixed income, currency, commodities and
    equity securities, as well as in real estate, private equity and
    other investments. We have incurred losses and may incur
    additional losses as a result of increased market volatility or
    decreased market liquidity, as these fluctuations may adversely





  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report


 


    page 24


 


 









Table of Contents


    impact the valuation of our trading and investment positions.
    Conversely, a decline in volatility may adversely affect results
    in our trading businesses, which depend on market volatility to
    create client and proprietary trading opportunities.

 

We may incur additional material losses in future periods due
    to write-downs in the value of financial instruments. We
    recorded significant net write-downs in the 2007 fiscal year,
    primarily related to U.S. ABS CDOs, sub-prime residential
    mortgages, and credit valuation adjustments related to hedging
    transactions with financial guarantors on U.S. ABS CDOs.
    The markets for U.S. ABS CDOs and other sub-prime
    residential mortgage exposures remain extremely illiquid in
    early 2008 and as a result, valuation of these exposures is
    complex and involves a comprehensive process including the use
    of quantitative modeling and management judgment. Valuation of
    these exposures will also continue to be impacted by external
    market factors including default rates, a decline in the value
    of the underlying property, such as residential or commercial
    real estate, rating agency actions, the prices at which
    observable market transactions occur and the financial strength
    of counterparties, such as financial guarantors, with whom we
    have economically hedged some of our exposure to these assets.
    Our ability to mitigate our risk by selling or hedging our
    exposures is also limited by the market environment.

 

Our business has been and may be adversely impacted by
    significant holdings of financial assets or significant loans or
    commitments to extend loans. In the course of our business,
    we often commit substantial amounts of capital to certain types
    of businesses or asset classes, including our trading,
    structured credit, residential and commercial real
    estate-related activities, investment banking, private equity
    and leveraged finance businesses. This commitment of capital
    exposes us to a number of risks, including market risk, in the
    case of our holdings of concentrated or illiquid positions in a
    particular asset class as part of our trading, structured
    credit, residential and commercial real estate-related
    activities, and credit risk, in the case of our leveraged
    lending businesses. Any decline in the value of such assets may
    reduce our revenues or result in losses.

 










   Credit
    Risk
    




Our business may be adversely impacted by an increase in our
    credit exposure related to trading, lending, and other business
    activities. We are exposed to potential credit-related
    losses that can occur as a result of an individual, counterparty
    or issuer being unable or unwilling to honor its contractual
    obligations. These credit exposures exist within lending
    relationships, commitments, letters of credit, derivatives,
    including transactions we may enter into to hedge our exposure
    to various assets, foreign exchange and other transactions.
    These exposures may arise, for example, from a decline in the
    financial condition of a counterparty, from entering into swap
    or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have
    obligations to make payments to us, from a decrease in the value
    of securities of third parties that we hold as collateral, or
    from extending credit to clients through loans or other
    arrangements. As our credit exposure increases, it could have an
    adverse effect on our business and profitability if material
    unexpected credit losses occur.

 










   Risks
    Related to our Commodities Business
    




We are exposed to environmental, reputational and regulatory
    risk as a result of our commodities related activities.
    Through our commodities business, we enter into
    exchange-traded contracts, financially settled over-the-counter
    (OTC) derivatives, contracts for physical delivery
    and contracts providing for the transportation, transmission
    and/or
    storage rights on or in vessels, barges, pipelines, transmission
    lines or storage facilities. Contracts relating to physical
    ownership, delivery
    and/or
    related activities can expose us to numerous risks, including
    performance, environmental and reputational risks. For example,
    we may incur civil or criminal liability under certain
    environmental laws and our business and reputation may be
    adversely affected. In addition, regulatory authorities have
    recently intensified scrutiny of certain energy markets, which
    has resulted in increased regulatory and legal enforcement,
    litigation and remedial proceedings involving companies engaged
    in the activities in which we are engaged.

 










   International
    Risk
    




We have an increasing international presence and as a result,
    we are increasingly subject to a number of risks in various
    jurisdictions. In the past years, we have expanded our
    international operations and expect to continue to do so in the
    future. This expansion, however, gives us a greater exposure to
    a number of risks, including economic, market, reputational,
    litigation and regulatory risks. For example, in many emerging
    markets, the regulatory regime governing financial services
    firms is still developing, and the regulatory authorities may
    adopt restrictive regulation or policies, such as exchange,
    price or capital controls, that could have an adverse effect on
    our businesses. In addition, in virtually all markets, we are
    competing with a number of established competitors that in some
    cases may have significant competitive advantages over us in
    those markets.

 










   Liquidity
    Risk
    




Our business and financial condition may be adversely
    impacted by an inability to borrow funds or sell assets to meet
    our obligations. We are exposed to liquidity risk, which is
    the potential inability to repay short-term borrowings with new
    borrowings or liquid assets that can be quickly converted into
    cash while meeting other obligations and continuing to operate
    as a going concern. Our liquidity may be impaired due to
    circumstances that we may be unable to control, such as general
    market disruptions, disruptions in the markets for any specific
    class of assets, including any disruption that would require us
    to honor commitments to provide liquidity to certain off-balance
    sheet vehicles, or an operational problem that affects our
    trading clients or ourselves. Our ability to sell assets may





  
  
  
  
  




 


 


    page 25


 












Table of Contents


    also be impaired if other market participants are seeking to
    sell similar assets at the same time. Our inability to borrow
    funds or sell assets to meet obligations, a negative change in
    our credit ratings that would have an adverse effect on our
    ability to borrow funds, increases in the amount of collateral
    required by counterparties, or regulatory capital restrictions
    imposed on the free flows of funds between us and our
    subsidiaries may have a negative effect on our business and
    financial condition.

 










   Operational
    Risk
    




We may incur losses due to the failure of people, internal
    processes and systems or from external events. Our business
    may be adversely impacted by operational failures or from
    unfavorable external events. Such operational risks may include
    exposure to theft and fraud, improper business practices, client
    suitability and servicing risks, unauthorized transactions,
    product complexity and pricing risk or from improper recording,
    evaluating or accounting for transactions. We could suffer
    financial loss, disruption of our business, liability to
    clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage from
    such events, which would affect our business and financial
    condition.

 

We may incur losses as a result of an inability to
    effectively evaluate or mitigate the risks in our businesses.
    Our businesses expose us to a wide and increasing number of
    risks, including market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk,
    operational risk and litigation risk. For each of these and
    other risks that we face, we attempt to formulate and refine a
    framework to identify and address such risk. We have in the past
    and may in the future incur losses as a result of a failure to
    correctly evaluate or effectively address the risks in our
    business activities.

 










   Litigation
    Risk
    




Legal proceedings could adversely affect our operating
    results for a particular period and impact our credit ratings.
    We have been named as a defendant in various legal actions,
    including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation
    arising in connection with our activities as a global
    diversified financial services institution. Some of the legal
    actions against us include claims for substantial compensatory
    and/or
    punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.
    Any prolonged decline in securities prices may lead to increased
    actions against many firms, including Merrill Lynch, and may
    lead to increased legal expenses and potential liability. In
    some cases, the issuers who would otherwise be the primary
    defendants are bankrupt or otherwise in financial distress.
    Given the number of these matters, some are likely to result in
    adverse judgments, penalties, injunctions, fines, or other
    relief. We are also involved in investigations
    and/or
    proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies.

 

    We may explore potential settlements before a case is taken
    through trial because of uncertainty, risks, and costs inherent
    in the litigation process. In accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 5,
    Accounting for Contingencies
    (SFAS No. 5), we will accrue a
    liability when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
    and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In many
    lawsuits, arbitrations and investigations, including almost all
    of the class action lawsuits disclosed in Other
    Information (Unaudited)  Legal Proceedings, it
    is not possible to determine whether a liability has been
    incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that
    liability until the matter is close to resolution, in which case
    no accrual is made until that time. In view of the inherent
    difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters,
    particularly in matters in which claimants seek substantial or
    indeterminate damages, we cannot predict what the eventual loss
    or range of loss related to such matters will be. Potential
    losses may be material to our operating results for any
    particular period and may impact our credit ratings.

 










   Regulatory
    and Legislative Risks
    




Many of our businesses are highly regulated and could be
    impacted, and in some instances adversely impacted, by
    regulatory and legislative initiatives around the world. Our
    businesses may be affected by various U.S. and
    non-U.S. legislative
    bodies and regulatory and exchange authorities, such as federal
    and state securities and bank regulators including the SEC, the
    Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the
    Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS), and the Utah
    Department of Financial Institutions; self-regulatory
    organizations including the Financial Industry Regulatory
    Authority (FINRA), the Commodity Futures Trading
    Commission (CFTC), the United Kingdom Financial
    Services Authority (FSA), the Japan Financial
    Services Agency (JFSA), and the Irish Financial
    Regulator (IFR); and industry participants that
    continue to review and, in many cases, adopt changes to their
    established rules and policies. New laws or regulations or
    changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations may
    also adversely affect our businesses. As we expand globally we
    will encounter new laws, regulations and requirements that could
    impact our ability to operate in new local markets.

 










   Competitive
    Environment
    




Competitive pressures in the financial services industry
    could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
    We compete globally for clients on the basis of price, the
    range of products that we offer, the quality of our services,
    our financial resources, and product and service innovation. The
    financial services industry continues to be affected by an
    intensely competitive environment, as demonstrated by the
    introduction of new technology platforms, consolidation through
    mergers, increased competition from new and established industry
    participants and diminishing margins in many mature products and
    services. We compete with U.S. and
    non-U.S. commercial
    banks and other broker-dealers in brokerage, underwriting,
    trading, financing and advisory businesses. For example, the
    financial services industry in general, including us, has
    experienced intense price competition in brokerage, as the
    ability to

    execute trades electronically, through the internet and through
    other alternative trading systems, has pressured trading
    commissions and spreads. Many of our
    non-U.S. competitors
    may have competitive advantages in their home markets. In
    addition, our business is substantially dependent on our
    continuing ability to compete effectively to attract and retain
    qualified employees, including successful FAs, investment
    bankers, trading and risk management professionals and other
    revenue-producing or support personnel.

 

    For further information on trading risks refer to Note 3 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 










   Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates



 










   Use
    of Estimates
    




    In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management
    makes estimates regarding:

 






     

    Valuations of assets and liabilities requiring fair value
    estimates;


 

     

    The outcome of litigation;


 

     

    The realization of deferred taxes and the recognition and
    measurement of uncertain tax positions;


 

     

    Assumptions and cash flow projections used in determining
    whether variable interest entities (VIEs) should be
    consolidated and the determination of the qualifying status of
    qualified special purpose entities (QSPEs);


 

     

    The carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets;


 

     

    The amortization period of intangible assets with definite lives;


 

     

    Valuation of share-based payment compensation arrangements; and


 

     

    Other matters that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of
    contingencies in the financial statements.



 

    Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available
    information. Therefore, actual results could differ from those
    estimates and could have a material impact on the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, and it is possible that such changes could
    occur in the near term. For more information regarding the
    specific methodologies used in determining estimates, refer to
    Use of Estimates in Note 1 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

 










   Valuation
    of Financial Instruments
    




    Proper valuation of financial instruments is a critical
    component of our financial statement preparation. We account for
    a significant portion of our financial instruments at fair value
    or consider fair value in our measurement. We account for
    certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value under
    various accounting literature, including SFAS No. 115,
    Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
    Securities, SFAS No. 133, Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and
    SFAS No. 159, Fair Value Option for Certain
    Financial Assets and Liabilities
    (SFAS No. 159). We also account for
    certain assets at fair value under applicable industry guidance,
    namely broker-dealer and investment company accounting guidance.

 

    In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management
    makes estimates regarding valuations of assets and liabilities
    requiring fair value measurements. These assets and liabilities
    include:

 






     

    Trading inventory and investment securities;


 

     

    Private equity and principal investments;


 

     

    Certain receivables under resale agreements and payables under
    repurchase agreements;


 

     

    Loans and allowance for loan losses and liabilities recorded for
    unrealized losses on unfunded commitments; and


 

     

    Certain long-term borrowings, primarily structured debt.



 

    See further discussion in Note 1 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

 

    We early adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 157
    Fair Value Measurements
    (SFAS No. 157) in the first quarter of
    2007. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price
    that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between marketplace
    participants at the measurement date (i.e., the exit price). An
    exit price notion does not assume that the transaction price is
    the same as the exit price and thus permits the recognition of
    inception gains and losses on a transaction in certain
    circumstances. An exit price notion requires the valuation to
    consider what a marketplace participant would pay to buy an
    asset or receive to assume a liability. Therefore, we must rely
    upon observable market data before we can utilize internally
    derived valuations.

 

    Fair values for exchange-traded securities and certain
    exchange-traded derivatives, principally certain options
    contracts, are based on quoted market prices. Fair values for
    OTC derivatives, principally forwards, options, and swaps,
    represent amounts estimated to be received from or paid to a
    market participant in settlement of these instruments. These
    derivatives are valued using pricing models based on the net
    present value of estimated future cash flows and directly
    observed prices from exchange-traded derivatives, other OTC

Table of Contents


    trades, or external pricing services and other inputs such as
    quoted interest and currency indices, while taking into account
    the counterpartys credit rating, or our own credit rating
    as appropriate.

 

    New and/or
    complex instruments may have immature or limited markets. As a
    result, the pricing models used for valuation often incorporate
    significant estimates and assumptions that market participants
    would use in pricing the instrument, which may impact the
    results of operations reported in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. For example, on long-dated and illiquid contracts we
    apply extrapolation methods to observed market data in order to
    estimate inputs and assumptions that are not directly
    observable. This enables us to mark to fair value all positions
    consistently when only a subset of prices is directly
    observable. Values for OTC derivatives are verified using
    observed information about the costs of hedging the risk and
    other trades in the market. As the markets for these products
    develop, we continually refine our pricing models to correlate
    more closely to the market price of these instruments. Obtaining
    the fair value for OTC derivative contracts requires the use of
    management judgment and estimates. In addition, during periods
    of market illiquidity, the valuation of certain cash products
    can also require significant judgment and the use of estimates
    by management. Examples of specific instruments and inputs that
    require significant judgment include:

 

Asset-Backed
    Securities Valuation


    In the most liquid markets, readily available or observable
    prices are used in valuing asset backed securities. In less
    liquid markets, such as those that we have encountered in the
    second half of 2007, the lack of these prices necessitates the
    use of other available information and modeling techniques to
    approximate the fair value for some of these securities.

 

    For certain classes of asset-backed securities where lack of
    observable prices is most severe, we employ a fundamental
    cashflow valuation approach. To determine fair value for these
    instruments, we employ various econometric techniques, coupled
    with collateral performance analysis, and review of market
    comparables, if any. We then project collateral expected losses,
    leading to deal-specific discounting of cash flows at market
    levels. More specifically, the valuation for our U.S. ABS
    CDO super senior securities is based on cash flow analysis
    including cumulative loss assumptions. These assumptions are
    derived from multiple inputs including mortgage remittance
    reports, housing prices and other market data. Relevant ABX
    indices are also analyzed as part of the overall valuation
    process.

 

Correlation


    We enter into a number of transactions where the performance is
    wholly or partly dependent on the relative performance of two or
    more assets. In these transactions, referred to as correlation
    trades, correlation between the assets can be a significant
    factor in the valuation. Examples of this type of transaction
    include: equity or foreign exchange baskets, constant maturity
    swap spreads (i.e., options where the performance is determined
    based upon the fluctuations between two benchmark interest
    rates), and commodity spread trades. Many correlations are
    available through external pricing services. Where external
    pricing information is not available, management uses estimates
    based on historical data, calibrated to more liquid market
    information. Unobservable credit correlation, such as that
    influencing the valuation of complex structured CDOs, is
    calibrated using a proxy approach (e.g., using implied
    correlation from traded credit index tranches as a proxy for
    calibrating correlation for a basket of single-name corporate
    investment grade credits that are infrequently traded).

 

Volatility


    We hold derivative positions whose values are dependent on
    volatilities for which market observable values are not
    available. These volatilities correspond to options with
    long-dated expiration dates, strikes significantly in or out of
    the money, and/or in the case of interest rate underlyings, a
    large tenor (i.e., an underlying interest rate reference that
    itself is long-dated). We use model-based extrapolation, proxy
    techniques, or historical analysis, to derive the unobservable
    volatility. These methods are selected based on available market
    information and are used across all asset classes. Volatility
    estimation can have a significant impact on valuations.

 

    Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 157, we followed the
    provisions of
    EITF 02-3,
Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held
    for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading
    and Risk Management Activities
    (EITF 02-3).
    Under
    EITF 02-3,
    recognition of day one gains and losses on derivative
    transactions was prohibited when model inputs that significantly
    impacted valuation were not observable. Day one gains and losses
    deferred at inception under
    EITF 02-3
    were recognized at the earlier of when the valuation of such
    derivative became observable or at the termination of the
    contract. SFAS No. 157 nullifies this guidance in
    EITF 02-3.
    Although this guidance in
    EITF 02-3
    has been nullified, the recognition of significant inception
    gains and losses that incorporate unobservable inputs are
    reviewed by management to ensure such gains and losses are
    derived from observable inputs
    and/or
    incorporate reasonable assumptions about the unobservable
    component, such as implied bid-offer adjustments.

 

Valuation
    Adjustments


    Certain financial instruments recorded at fair value are
    initially measured using mid-market prices which results in
    gross long and short positions marked-to-market at the same
    pricing level prior to the application of position netting. The
    resulting net positions are then adjusted to fair value
    representing the exit price as defined in
    SFAS No. 157. The significant adjustments include
    liquidity and counterparty credit risk.





  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report


 


    page 28


 


 









Table of Contents


Liquidity


    We make adjustments to bring a position from a mid-market to a
    bid or offer price, depending upon the net open position. We
    value net long positions at bid prices and net short positions
    at offer prices. These adjustments are based upon either
    observable or implied bid-offer prices.

 

Counterparty
    Credit Risk


    In determining fair value, we consider both the credit risk of
    our counterparties, as well as our own creditworthiness. We
    attempt to mitigate credit risk to third parties by entering
    into netting and collateral arrangements. Net exposure is then
    measured with consideration of a counterpartys
    creditworthiness and is incorporated into the fair value of the
    respective instruments. We generally base the calculation of the
    credit risk adjustment for derivatives upon observable market
    credit spreads.

 

    SFAS No. 157 also requires that we consider our own
    creditworthiness when determining the fair value of an
    instrument. The approach to measuring the impact of our credit
    risk on an instrument is done in the same manner as for third
    party credit risk. The impact of our credit risk is incorporated
    into the fair valuation, even when credit risk is not readily
    observable in the pricing of an instrument, such as in OTC
    derivatives contracts.

 

    In accordance with SFAS No. 157, we have categorized
    our financial instruments, based on the priority of the inputs
    to the valuation technique, into a three level fair value
    hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
    to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or
    liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
    unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to
    measure the financial instruments fall within different levels
    of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest
    level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of
    the instrument.

 

    Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the
    valuation techniques as follows:

 

Level 1


    Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on
    unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in
    an active market that we have the ability to access (examples
    include active exchange-traded equity securities, exchange
    traded derivatives, most U.S. Government and agency
    securities, and certain other sovereign government obligations).

 

Level 2


    Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on
    quoted prices in markets that are not active or model inputs
    that are observable either directly or indirectly for
    substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
    Level 2 inputs include the following:

 







 
    a) 


    Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
    markets (for example, restricted stock);


 

 
    b) 


    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
    non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal
    bonds, which trade infrequently);


 

 
    c) 


    Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the
    full term of the asset or liability (examples include most
    over-the-counter derivatives including interest rate and
    currency swaps); and


 

 
    d) 


    Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or
    corroborated by observable market data through correlation or
    other means for substantially the full term of the asset or
    liability (examples include certain residential and commercial
    mortgage related assets, including loans, securities and
    derivatives).



 
 

Level 3


    Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on
    prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both
    unobservable and significant to the overall fair value
    measurement. These inputs reflect managements own
    assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use
    in pricing the asset or liability (examples include certain
    private equity investments, certain residential and commercial
    mortgage related assets (including loans, securities and
    derivatives), and long-dated or complex derivatives including
    certain equity derivatives and long-dated options on gas and
    power).

 

    See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

 

Valuation
    controls


    Given the prevalence of fair value measurement in our financial
    statements, the control functions related to the fair valuation
    process are a critical component of our business operations.
    Prices and model inputs provided by our trading units are
    verified with external pricing sources to ensure that the use of
    observable market data is used whenever possible. Similarly,
    valuation models created by our trading units are independently
    verified and tested. These control functions are independent of
    the trading units and include Business Unit Finance, the Product
    Valuation Group and Global Risk Management.

   Litigation
    




    We have been named as a defendant in various legal actions,
    including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation
    arising in connection with our activities as a global
    diversified financial services institution. We are also involved
    in investigations
    and/or
    proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies. In
    accordance with SFAS No. 5, we will accrue a liability
    when it is probable that a liability has been incurred, and the
    amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In many lawsuits
    and arbitrations, including class action lawsuits, it is not
    possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or
    to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability
    until the case is close to resolution, in which case no accrual
    is made until that time. In view of the inherent difficulty of
    predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases in
    which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages, we
    cannot predict or estimate what the eventual loss or range of
    loss related to such matters will be. See Note 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements and Other
    Information  Legal Proceedings for further
    information.

 










   Variable
    Interest Entities and Qualified Special Purpose Entities
    




    In the normal course of business, we enter into a variety of
    transactions with VIEs. The applicable accounting guidance
    requires us to perform a qualitative
    and/or
    quantitative analysis of each new VIE at inception to determine
    whether we must consolidate the VIE. In performing this
    analysis, we make assumptions regarding future performance of
    assets held by the VIE, taking into account estimates of credit
    risk, estimates of the fair value of assets, timing of cash
    flows, and other significant factors. Although a VIEs
    actual results may differ from projected outcomes, a revised
    consolidation analysis is not required subsequent to the initial
    assessment unless a reconsideration event occurs. If a VIE meets
    the conditions to be considered a QSPE, it is typically not
    required to be consolidated by us. A QSPE is a passive entity
    whose activities must be significantly limited. A servicer of
    the assets held by a QSPE may have discretion in restructuring
    or working out assets held by the QSPE, as long as that
    discretion is significantly limited and the parameters of that
    discretion are fully described in the legal documents that
    established the QSPE. Determining whether the activities of a
    QSPE and its servicer meet these conditions requires management
    judgment.

 










   Income
    Taxes
    




    Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by
    us and various taxing authorities. We regularly assess the
    likelihood of assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions by
    making judgments and interpretations about the application of
    these complex tax laws and estimating the impact to our
    financial statements.

 

    We are under examination by the Internal Revenue Service
    (IRS) and other tax authorities in countries
    including Japan and the United Kingdom, and states in which we
    have significant business operations, such as New York. The tax
    years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The IRS audits are
    in progress for the tax years
    20042006.
    Japan tax authorities have recently commenced the audit for the
    fiscal tax years March 31, 2004 through March 31,
    2007. In the United Kingdom, the audit for the tax year 2005 is
    in progress. The Canadian tax authorities have commenced the
    audit of the tax years
    20042005.
    New York State and New York City audits are in progress for the
    years
    20022006.
    Also, we paid an assessment to Japan in 2005 for the fiscal tax
    years April 1, 1998 through March 31, 2003, in
    relation to the taxation of income that was originally reported
    in other jurisdictions. During the third quarter of 2005, we
    started the process of obtaining clarification from
    international tax authorities on the appropriate allocation of
    income among multiple jurisdictions to prevent double taxation.
    See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    description of tax years that remain subject to examination by
    major tax jurisdiction.

 

    We filed briefs with the U.S. Tax Court in 2005 with
    respect to a tax case, which had been remanded for further
    proceedings in accordance with a 2004 opinion of the
    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The
    U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the initial adverse opinion
    that the U.S. Tax Court rendered in 2003 against us, with
    respect to a 1987 transaction, but remanded the case to the
    U.S. Tax Court to consider a new argument raised. The
    amount in dispute has been fully paid, and no benefit has been
    recognized. The U.S. Tax Court has not issued a decision on
    this remanded matter, and it is uncertain as to when a decision
    will be rendered.

 

    At December 28, 2007, we had a United Kingdom net operating
    loss carryforward of approximately $13.5 billion. This loss
    has an unlimited carryforward period and a tax benefit has been
    recognized for the deferred tax asset with no valuation
    allowance.

 

    During 2007, we adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). We
    believe that the estimate of the level of unrecognized tax
    benefits is in accordance with FIN 48 and is appropriate in
    relation to the potential for additional assessments. We adjust
    the level of unrecognized tax benefits when there is more
    information available, or when an event occurs requiring a
    change. The reassessment of unrecognized tax benefits could have
    a material impact on our effective tax rate in the period in
    which it occurs.

   Business
    Environment(1)




    Global financial markets experienced significant stress during
    2007, primarily driven by challenging conditions in the credit
    markets during the second half of the year related to
    U.S. sub-prime residential mortgages and related assets
    (including CDOs collateralized by sub-prime residential
    mortgages), and the markets for loans and bonds related to
    leveraged finance transactions. For example, during the second
    half of the year ABX indices experienced significant widening,
    with the A and AAA classes moving substantially off
    par for the first time in 2007. This adverse market environment
    began to intensify in the beginning of the third quarter and was
    characterized by significant credit spread widening, prolonged
    illiquidity, reduced price transparency and increased
    volatility. As conditions in these markets deteriorated, other
    areas such as the asset-backed commercial paper market also
    experienced decreased liquidity, and the equity markets
    experienced short-term weakness and increased volatility. In
    response to these conditions, the Federal Reserve, the European
    Central Bank and other central banks injected significant
    liquidity into the markets during the second half of the year
    and the Federal Reserve Systems Federal Open Market
    Committee (FOMC) lowered benchmark interest rates by
    100 basis points to 4.25% at year-end. In addition, the
    FOMC reduced benchmark interest rates by 125 basis points in
    January 2008. Long-term interest rates, as measured by the
    10-year
    U.S. Treasury bond, ended the year at 4.03%, down from
    4.71% at the end of 2006. In the equity markets, major
    U.S. equity indices increased moderately during 2007 with
    the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the NASDAQ Composite Index and
    the Standard & Poors 500 Index up by
    6%, 10% and 4%, respectively. Oil prices hit a record high and
    the U.S. dollar hit a low against the euro during the year.
    Overall the global economy continued to grow during 2007, albeit
    slower than in 2006.

 

    Global fixed income trading volumes increased during the year in
    asset classes such as U.S. government and agency securities
    with average daily trading volumes up approximately 8% and 11%,
    respectively. Trading volumes across mortgage-backed securities
    also increased compared to 2006, up approximately 27% during the
    year despite the reduction in liquidity for certain instruments.

 

    Global equity indices generally ended the year with mixed
    results. In Europe, the Dow Jones STOXX 50 Index was flat
    from 2006 while the FTSE 100 Index increased 4%. Asian
    equity markets were mixed as Japans Nikkei 225 Stock
    Average fell 11% while Hong Kongs Hang Seng Index surged
    37%. Indias Sensex Index rose 47%. In Latin America,
    Brazils Bovespa Index was up 44% from 2006.

 

    U.S. equity trading volumes increased during the year as
    both the dollar volume and number of shares traded on the New
    York Stock Exchange and on the Nasdaq increased compared to
    2006. Equity market volatility increased significantly for both
    the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 during the year,
    as indicated by higher average levels for the Chicago Board
    Options Exchange SPX Volatility Index and the American Stock
    Exchange QQQ Volatility Index, respectively.

 

    Global debt and equity underwriting volumes for the full year of
    2007 were $7.0 trillion, down 5% from 2006 impacted by
    decreased volumes during the second half of the year which were
    down 27%. Global debt underwriting volumes for the full year of
    2007 were $5.9 trillion, down 11% from 2006 and were down
    39% during the second half of the year compared to the
    prior-year period. Global equity underwriting volumes of
    $1.1 trillion were up 50% compared to 2006.

 

    Merger and acquisition (M&A) activity increased
    during 2007 as the value of global announced deals was
    $4.9 trillion, up 24% from 2006. Global completed M&A
    activity was $4.6 trillion, up 28% from 2006.

 

    While our results may vary based on global economic and market
    trends, we believe that the outlook for growth in most of our
    global businesses, including Equity Markets, Investment Banking,
    Global Wealth Management and certain FICC businesses remains
    favorable due to positive underlying fundamentals, high market
    volumes, and the resiliency of these markets. This remains
    especially true for markets outside of the United States, such
    as the Pacific Rim. However, the challenging conditions in
    certain credit markets, such as the sub-prime mortgage market,
    have continued into early 2008. Since year-end, these markets
    have shown renewed signs of volatility and weakness as evidenced
    by recent rating agency downgrades of residential
    mortgage-backed securities and U.S. ABS CDOs, increased
    expectations of future rating agency actions, and increased
    default and delinquency rates.

 

    During 2007, FICC revenues were adversely affected by the
    substantial deterioration in the value of many of these
    exposures, particularly during the second half of 2007.  At the
    end of 2007, we maintained exposures to these markets through
    securities, derivatives, loans and loan commitments. See
    U.S. ABS CDO and Other Mortgage-Related Activities
    on page 34 for further detail.

 

    The markets for these U.S. ABS CDO exposures remain
    extremely illiquid and as a result, valuation of these exposures
    is complex and involves a comprehensive process including the
    use of quantitative modeling and management judgment. Valuation
    of these exposures will also continue to be impacted by external
    market factors including default rates, rating agency actions,
    and the prices at which observable market transactions occur.
    Our ability to mitigate our risk by selling or hedging our
    exposures is also limited by the market environment. Our future
    results may continue to be materially impacted by these
    positions.

   Consolidated
    Results of Operations
    




    Our net loss from continuing operations was $8.6 billion
    for 2007 compared to net earnings from continuing operations of
    $7.1 billion in 2006 as net revenues in 2007 declined 67%
    from the prior year. The decrease in net revenues was primarily
    driven by our credit and structured finance and investment
    businesses which were impacted by deterioration in the credit
    markets, resulting in net losses on our U.S. ABS CDO and
    sub-prime residential mortgage positions and non-investment
    grade lending commitments. Losses per diluted share from
    continuing operations were $10.73 for 2007, compared to net
    earnings per diluted share of $7.17 in 2006. Net earnings from
    discontinued operations were $860 million up from
    $402 million in 2006, driven by a net gain of
    $316 million recognized on the sale of MLIG. Refer to
    Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information on discontinued operations.

 

2007 Compared to
    2006


    Principal transactions revenues include both realized and
    unrealized gains and losses on trading assets and trading
    liabilities and investment securities classified as trading
    investments. Principal transactions revenues were negative
    $12.1 billion compared to $7.2 billion a year-ago
    driven primarily by losses in our credit and structured finance
    and investment businesses, which includes our U.S. ABS CDO
    and residential mortgage-related businesses. Deterioration in
    the credit markets, prolonged illiquidity, reduced price
    transparency, increased volatility and a weaker
    U.S. housing market all contributed to the decline in these
    businesses and the difficult environment experienced,
    particularly in the third and fourth quarters of 2007. These
    decreases were partially offset by increases in revenues
    generated from our rates and currencies, equity-linked, cash
    equities trading and financing and services businesses as well
    as gains arising from the widening of Merrill Lynch credit
    spreads on certain of our long-term debt liabilities. Principal
    transactions revenues are primarily reported in our GMI business
    segment. Please refer to the FICC and Equity Markets discussions
    within the GMI business segment results for additional details
    on the key drivers.

 

    Net interest profit is a function of (i) the level and mix
    of total assets and liabilities, including trading assets owned,
    deposits, financing and lending transactions, and trading
    strategies associated with our businesses, and (ii) the
    prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest
    rates. Net interest profit is an integral component of trading
    activity. In assessing the profitability of our client
    facilitation and trading activities, we view principal
    transactions and net interest profit in the aggregate as net
    trading revenues. Changes in the composition of trading
    inventories and hedge positions can cause the mix of principal
    transactions and net interest profit to fluctuate. Net interest
    profit was $5.5 billion, up 32% from 2006 due primarily to
    higher net interest revenue from deposit spreads earned and
    higher returns from interest-bearing assets reflecting higher
    average asset balances in 2007, partially offset by increased
    interest expense driven by increased average long and short-term
    borrowings in 2007. Net interest profit is reported in both our
    GMI and GWM business segments.

 

    Commissions revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in
    listed and OTC equity securities and commodities, insurance
    products and options. Commission revenues also include
    distribution fees for promoting and distributing mutual funds
    and hedge funds. Commission revenues were $7.3 billion, up
    22% from 2006, due primarily to an increase in global
    transaction volumes, particularly in listed equities and mutual
    funds as a result of increased market volatility. Commissions
    revenues are primarily reported in our GMI business segment, and
    a portion is also reported in GWM.

 

    Investment banking revenues include (i) origination
    revenues representing fees earned from the underwriting of debt,
    equity and equity-linked securities, as well as loan syndication
    and commitment fees and (ii) strategic advisory services
    revenues including merger and acquisition and other investment
    banking advisory fees. Investment banking revenues were
    $5.6 billion, up 20% from 2006, driven by increased
    revenues in equity origination and strategic advisory services,
    which were partially offset by a decline in revenues from debt
    origination primarily related to the leveraged finance business.
    Investment banking revenues are primarily reported in our GMI
    business segment but also include origination revenues in GWM.
    Please refer to the Investment Banking discussion within the GMI
    business segment results for additional detail on the key
    drivers.

 

    Managed accounts and other fee-based revenues primarily consist
    of asset-priced portfolio service fees earned from the
    administration of separately managed and other investment
    accounts for retail investors, annual account fees, and certain
    other account-related fees. In addition, until the BlackRock
    merger at the end of the third quarter of 2006, managed accounts
    and other fee-based revenues also included fees earned from the
    management and administration of retail mutual funds and
    institutional funds such as pension assets, and performance fees
    earned on certain separately managed accounts and institutional
    money management arrangements. Managed accounts and other
    fee-based revenues were $5.5 billion, down 13% from 2006,
    driven primarily by the absence of MLIMs asset management
    revenues in 2007 as a result of the BlackRock merger at the end
    of the third quarter of 2006. This decrease was partially offset
    by higher asset-based fees in GWM reflecting the impact of net
    inflows into fee-based accounts and higher average equity market
    values. Managed accounts and other fee-based revenues are
    primarily driven by our GWM business segment. Please refer to
    the GWM business segment discussion for additional detail on the
    key drivers.

 

    Earnings from equity method investments include our pro rata
    share of income and losses associated with investments accounted
    for under the equity method of accounting. Earnings from equity
    method investments were $1.6 billion, up 193% from 2006
    primarily driven

Table of Contents


    by increased earnings from our investments in BlackRock and
    certain partnerships. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information on equity method
    investments.

 

    Other revenues include gains/(losses) on investment securities,
    including unrealized losses on certain available-for-sale
    securities, gains/(losses) on private equity investments that
    are held for capital appreciation
    and/or
    current income, and gains/(losses) on loans and other
    miscellaneous items. Other revenues were negative
    $2.2 billion, compared to $2.9 billion in 2006. The
    decrease primarily reflects loan-related losses of
    $1.7 billion, a year-over-year decrease in the value of our
    private equity investments of $1.2 billion, due primarily
    to the decline in value of our publicly traded investments,
    other than temporary impairment charges on available-for-sale
    securities of approximately $900 million and write-downs of
    approximately $600 million on leveraged finance commitments.

 

    The gain on the merger with BlackRock was $2.0 billion in
    2006. This non-recurring gain entirely related to the merger of
    Merrill Lynchs MLIM business with BlackRock that was
    completed in the third quarter of 2006. For more information on
    this merger, refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

 

    Compensation and benefits expenses were $15.9 billion for
    2007, compared to $16.9 billion in 2006, which included a
    one-time charge of approximately $1.8 billion related to
    the adoption of SFAS No. 123R Share Based
    Payment (SFAS No. 123R). Excluding
    this one-time charge in 2006, compensation expenses were up
    approximately 6%, reflecting higher staffing levels and
    increased productivity from financial advisors, partially offset
    by the absence of compensation expenses related to MLIM in 2007.
    While compensation expenses increased, average compensation per
    employee was down in 2007 from 2006 levels. See
    Exhibit 99.1, filed with our 2007 10-K, for a
    reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.

 

    Non-compensation expenses were $8.2 billion in 2007, up 15%
    from 2006. Communication and technology costs were
    $2.1 billion, up 12% from 2006 primarily due to increased
    costs related to a significant number of system development
    projects. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees were
    $1.4 billion, up 29% from 2006, primarily due to higher
    transaction volumes, higher equity brokerage fees and exchange
    fees. Occupancy costs and related depreciation were
    $1.1 billion, up 15% from a year-ago principally due to
    higher office rental expenses and office space added via
    acquisitions. Professional fees were $1.0 billion, up 16%
    from 2006 driven by higher legal and other professional costs.
    Advertising and market development costs were $785 million,
    up 14% from 2006 primarily due to increased costs associated
    with increased business activity and higher deal-related
    expenses. Other expenses were $1.5 billion, up 10% from a
    year ago due primarily to the write-off of $160 million of
    identifiable intangible assets related to our acquisition of the
    First Franklin mortgage origination franchise and related
    servicing platform acquired from National City Corporation
    (collectively First Franklin). For further
    information on First Franklin, refer to Note 16 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

U.S. ABS CDO and
    Other Mortgage-Related Activities


    The challenging market conditions that existed during the second
    half of 2007, particularly those relating to ABS CDOs and
    sub-prime residential mortgages, remained at year end. Despite
    the significant reduction of our net exposures to these markets
    during the third and fourth quarters, at year end we maintained
    exposures to these markets through securities, derivatives,
    loans and loan commitments. The following discussion details our
    activities and net exposures at the end of 2007.

 

U.S. Sub-Prime
    Residential Mortgage-Related Activities


    We view sub-prime mortgages as single-family residential
    mortgages displaying more than one high risk characteristic,
    such as: (i) the borrower has a low FICO score (generally
    below 660); (ii) a high loan-to-value (LTV)
    ratio (LTV greater than 80% without borrower paid mortgage
    insurance); (iii) the borrower has a high debt-to-income
    ratio (greater than 45%); or (iv) stated/limited income
    documentation. Sub-prime mortgage-related securities are those
    securities that derive more than 50% of their value from
    sub-prime mortgages.

 

    As part of our U.S. sub-prime residential mortgage-related
    activities, sub-prime mortgage loans were originated through
    First Franklin or purchased in pools from third-party
    originators for subsequent sale or securitization.
    Mortgage-backed securities are structured based on the
    characteristics of the underlying mortgage collateral, sold to
    investors and subsequently traded in the secondary capital
    markets. As a result of the significant deterioration in the
    sub-prime mortgage market in 2007, we have substantially reduced
    our U.S. sub-prime residential mortgage origination,
    mortgage purchase, and securitization activities, as well as
    warehouse lending facilities. As of December 28, 2007 we
    have ceased originating sub-prime mortgages and are evaluating
    our continued involvement in this market.

 

    At December 28, 2007, our U.S. sub-prime residential
    mortgage net exposure (excluding Merrill Lynchs bank
    sub-prime residential mortgage-related securities portfolio
    which is described in U.S. Banks Investment Securities
    Portfolio) consisted of the following:

 






     

Sub-prime whole loans: First Franklin originated mortgage
    loans through its retail and wholesale channels. Additionally,
    we purchased pools of whole loans from third-party mortgage
    originators. As a result of the significant deterioration in the
    sub-prime mortgage market in 2007, we currently are not
    originating or purchasing sub-prime residential mortgages. Prior
    to their sale or securitization, whole loans are predominantly
    reported on our consolidated balance sheets in loans, notes and
    mortgages and we account for such loans as held for sale.







  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report


 


    page 34


 


 









Table of Contents


    We value securitizable whole loans on an as-if
    securitized basis based on estimated performance of the
    underlying mortgage pool collateral, rating agency credit
    structure assumptions and market pricing for similar
    securitizations. Key characteristics include underlying borrower
    credit quality and collateral performance, mortgage terms and
    conditions, assumptions on prepayments, delinquencies and
    defaults. Non-securitizable loans are valued using a combination
    of discounted liquidation value and re-performing value.

 






     

Residuals: We retain and purchase mortgage residual
    interests, which represent the subordinated classes and
    equity/first-loss tranche from our residential mortgage-backed
    securitization activity. We have retained residuals from the
    securitizations of third-party whole loans we have purchased as
    well as from our First Franklin loan originations.



 

    We value residuals by modeling the present value of projected
    cash flows that we expect to receive, based on actual and
    projected performance of the mortgages underlying a particular
    securitization. Key determinants affecting our estimates of
    future cash flows include estimates for borrower prepayments,
    delinquencies, defaults and loss severities. Modeled performance
    and loan level loss projections are adjusted monthly to reflect
    actual borrower performance information that we receive from
    trustees and loan servicers.

 






     

 Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS):
    We retain and purchase securities from the securitizations
    of loans, including sub-prime residential mortgages. We value
    RMBS securities based on observable prices and securitization
    cash flow model analysis.


 

     

 Warehouse lending: Warehouse loans represent
    collateralized revolving loan facilities to originators of
    financial assets, such as sub-prime residential mortgages. These
    mortgages typically serve as collateral for the facility. We
    generally value these loans at amortized cost with an allowance
    for loan losses established for credit losses estimated to exist
    in the portfolio unless deemed to be permanently impaired. In
    the case of an impairment, the loan receivable value is adjusted
    to reflect the valuation of the whole loan collateral underlying
    the facility if the value is less than amortized cost.



 

    The following table provides a summary of our residential
    mortgage-related net exposures and losses, excluding net
    exposures to residential mortgage-backed securities held in our
    U.S. banks for investment purposes which is described in
    the U.S. Banks Investments Securities Portfolio
    section below.

Primarily represents unrealized
    losses on net exposures.
    


 

    During 2007, our U.S. sub-prime residential
    mortgage-related net exposures declined significantly as a
    result of unrealized losses incurred, securitizations, sales,
    hedges and changes in loan commitments and related funding.

 

Other Residential
    Mortgage-Related Activities


    In addition to our U.S. sub-prime related net exposures, we
    also had net exposures related to other residential
    mortgage-related activities. These activities consist of the
    following:

 






     

U.S. Alt-A: We had net exposures of
    $2.7 billion at the end of 2007, which consisted primarily
    of residential mortgage-backed securities collateralized by
    Alt-A residential mortgages. These net exposures resulted from
    secondary market trading activity or were retained from our
    securitizations of Alt-A residential mortgages, which were
    purchased from third-party mortgage originators. We do not
    originate
    Alt-A
    mortgages.



 

    We view Alt-A mortgages as single-family residential mortgages
    that are generally higher credit quality than sub-prime loans
    but have characteristics that would disqualify the borrower from
    a traditional prime loan.
    Alt-A
    lending characteristics may include one

Table of Contents


    or more of the following: (i) limited documentation;
    (ii) high combined-loan-to-value (CLTV)
    ratio (CLTV greater than 80%); (iii) loans secured by
    non-owner occupied properties; or (iv) debt-to-income ratio
    above normal limits.

 






     

 U.S. Prime: We had net exposures of
    $28.2 billion at the end of 2007, which consisted primarily
    of prime mortgage whole loans, including approximately
    $12 billion of prime loans originated with GWM clients and
    $9.7 billion of prime loans originated by First Republic,
    an operating division of Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Co.,
    FSB (MLBT-FSB). We also purchase prime whole loans
    from third-party originators for securitization and for the
    investment portfolios of Merrill Lynch Bank USA
    (MLBUSA) and MLBT-FSB.


 

     

 Non-U.S.:
We had net exposures of $9.6 billion at the end of 2007
    which consisted primarily of residential mortgage whole loans
    originated in the United Kingdom, as well as through mortgage
    originators in the Pacific Rim.


 

     

 Mortgage Servicing Rights: We own approximately
    $400 million of mortgage servicing rights which represent
    the right to current and future cash flows based on contractual
    servicing fees for mortgage loans. In connection with our
    residential mortgage businesses, we may retain or acquire
    mortgage servicing rights. See Note 6 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information.



 

U.S. ABS CDO
    Activities


    In addition to our U.S. sub-prime residential
    mortgage-related exposures, we have exposure to U.S. ABS
    CDOs, which are securities collateralized by a pool of
    asset-backed securities (ABS), for which the
    underlying collateral is primarily sub-prime residential
    mortgage loans.

 

    We engaged in the underwriting and sale of U.S. ABS CDOs,
    which involved the following steps: (i) determining
    investor interest or responding to inquiries or mandates
    received; (ii) engaging a CDO collateral manager who is
    responsible for selection of the ABS securities that will become
    the underlying collateral for the U.S. ABS CDO securities;
    (iii) obtaining credit ratings from one or more rating
    agencies for U.S. ABS CDO securities;
    (iv) securitizing and pricing the various tranches of the
    U.S. ABS CDO at representative market rates; and
    (v) distributing the U.S. ABS CDO securities to
    investors or retaining them for Merrill Lynch. As a result of
    the significant deterioration in the sub-prime mortgage market
    in 2007, we currently are not underwriting U.S. ABS CDOs.

 

    Our U.S. ABS CDO net exposure primarily consists of our
    super senior ABS CDO portfolio, as well as secondary trading
    exposures related to our ABS CDO business.

 

U.S. Super
    Senior ABS CDO Portfolio


    Super senior positions represent our exposure to the senior most
    tranche in an ABS CDOs capital structure. This
    tranches claims have priority to the proceeds from
    liquidated cash ABS CDO assets. Our exposure to super senior ABS
    CDOs includes the following securities, which are primarily held
    as derivative positions in the form of total return swaps:

 






     

    High-grade super senior positions, which are ABS CDOs with
    underlying collateral having an average credit rating of Aa3/A1
    at inception of the underwriting by Moodys Investor
    Services;


 

     

    Mezzanine super senior positions, which are ABS CDOs with
    underlying collateral having an average credit rating of
    Baa2/Baa3 at inception of the underwriting by Moodys
    Investor Services; and


 

     

    CDO-squared super senior positions, which are ABS CDOs with
    underlying collateral consisting of other ABS CDO securities
    which have collateral attributes typically similar to high-grade
    and mezzanine super senior positions.



 

    Despite the credit rating of these ABS CDO securities (typically
    AAA at inception of the underwriting), their fair value at
    December 28, 2007 reflected unprecedented market
    illiquidity and the deterioration in the value of the underlying
    sub-prime mortgage collateral. Additionally, rating agencies
    have been actively reviewing, and in some cases downgrading,
    these assets and we expect that they will continue to be subject
    to ongoing rating agency review in the near term.

 

Secondary
    Trading Related to the ABS CDO Business


    We have secondary trading exposures related to our ABS CDO
    business, which consists of RMBS and CDO positions previously
    held in CDO warehouses awaiting securitization, retained
    securities from CDO securitizations, and related hedges.

 

    For total U.S. super senior ABS CDOs, long exposures were
    $30.4 billion and short exposures were $23.6 billion
    at December 28, 2007. Short exposures primarily consist of
    purchases of credit default swap protection from various third
    parties, including financial guarantors, insurers and other
    market participants.

Represents long and short exposure
    of hedges. These hedges are affected by a variety of factors
    that impact the degree of their effectiveness, including
    differences in attachment point, timing of cash flows, control
    rights, litigation, the creditworthiness of the counterparty,
    limited recourse to counterparties and other basis risks.

Primarily represents unrealized
    losses on net exposures. Amounts exclude credit valuation
    adjustments of negative $2.6 billion related to financial
    guarantor exposures on U.S. super senior ABS CDOs. See table
    regarding financial guarantor exposures.
    


 

Financial
    Guarantors


    We hedge a portion of our gross exposures to U.S. super
    senior ABS CDOs with various market participants, including
    financial guarantors. Financial guarantors are generally highly
    rated monoline insurance companies that provide credit support
    for a security either through a financial guaranty insurance
    policy on a particular security or through an instrument such as
    a credit default swap (CDS). Under a CDS, the
    financial guarantor generally agrees to compensate the
    counterparty to the swap for the deterioration in the value of
    the underlying security upon an occurrence of a credit event,
    such as a failure by the underlying obligor on the security to
    pay principal or interest.

 

    We hedged a portion of our gross exposures on U.S. super
    senior ABS CDOs with certain financial guarantors through the
    execution of CDS that are structured to replicate standard
    financial guaranty insurance policies, which provide for timely
    payment of interest and ultimate payment of principal at their
    scheduled maturity date. CDS gains and losses are based on the
    fair value of the referenced ABS CDOs. Depending upon the
    creditworthiness of the financial guarantor hedge counterparty,
    we may record credit valuation adjustments in estimating the
    fair value of the CDS.

 

    At December 28, 2007 our short exposures from credit
    default swaps with financial guarantors to economically hedge
    certain U.S. super senior ABS CDOs was $13.8 billion, which
    represented credit default swaps with a notional amount of
    $19.9 billion that have been adjusted for mark-to-market
    gains of $6.1 billion. The fair value of these credit
    default swaps at December 28, 2007 was $3.5 billion,
    after taking into account a $2.6 billion credit valuation
    adjustment related to certain financial guarantors. Subsequent
    to year-end, market conditions have deteriorated resulting in
    negative rating agency actions for certain financial guarantors.
    We continue to monitor industry and company specific
    developments. Further credit deterioration of the financial
    guarantors who are counterparties to our credit derivatives
    could have an adverse effect on our future financial performance.

 

    The following table provides a summary of our total financial
    guarantor exposures for U.S. super senior ABS CDOs as of
    December 28, 2007.

U.S. Banks
    Investment Securities Portfolio


    The investment securities portfolio of MLBUSA and MLBT-FSB
    includes investment securities comprising various asset classes.
    The investment portfolio includes sub-prime mortgage-related
    securities, as well as ABS CDOs whose underlying collateral
    includes certain sub-prime residential mortgage-backed
    securities. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with
    Merrill Lynchs investment securities.

 

    At December 28, 2007, our net exposures to sub-prime
    mortgage related securities and ABS CDOs whose underlying
    collateral includes sub-prime residential mortgage-backed
    securities in the U.S. banks investment portfolio was
    $4.2 billion. The amount of losses related to these
    securities recognized in our 2007 Consolidated Statement of
    (Loss)/Earnings was approximately $700 million.

 

Other
    Exposures in the U.S. Banks Investment Securities
    Portfolio


    In addition to the U.S. sub-prime residential
    mortgage-related securities, our U.S. banks investment
    securities portfolio also includes other securities at
    December 28, 2007 consisting of
    Alt-A
    residential mortgage-backed securities (net exposure
    $7.1 billion), commercial mortgage-backed securities (net
    exposure $5.8 billion), prime residential mortgage-backed
    securities (net exposure $4.2 billion), non-residential
    asset-backed securities (net exposure $1.2 billion) and
    non-residential CDOs (net exposure $0.9 billion). These
    securities are included as part of our overall
    available-for-sale investment portfolio and recorded in mortgage
    and asset-backed securities.

 

    MLBUSA acts as administrator to a Merrill Lynch established
    asset-backed commercial paper conduit (Conduit)
    vehicle and previously acted as administrator for another
    Merrill Lynch established Conduit. MLBUSA also either provides
    or provided liquidity facilities to these Conduits and to a
    third Conduit, not established by Merrill Lynch, that protect
    commercial paper holders against short term changes in the fair
    value of the assets held by the Conduits in the event of a
    disruption in the commercial paper market, as well as credit
    facilities to the Conduits that protect commercial paper
    investors against credit losses for up to a certain percentage
    of the portfolio of assets held by the respective Conduits. The
    assets owned by these Conduits included sub-prime residential
    mortgage-backed securities and ABS CDO securities whose
    underlying collateral included certain sub-prime residential
    mortgage-backed securities. During the fourth quarter of 2007,
    Merrill Lynch purchased the remaining assets of one of the
    Merrill Lynch established Conduits through the exercise of its
    liquidity facility and as a result the facility is no longer
    outstanding. Merrill Lynch does not have any remaining exposure
    to this Conduit as it is inactive. The assets remaining in the
    other Merrill Lynch established Conduit are primarily auto and
    equipment loans and lease receivables. In the fourth quarter of
    2007, Merrill Lynch became the primary beneficiary for the
    remaining Conduit, which was not established by Merrill Lynch,
    as a result of a reconsideration event under FIN 46R. This
    Conduit was consolidated by Merrill Lynch and the facility is
    not considered outstanding. Refer to Notes 6 and 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on
    Conduits.

 

2006 Compared to
    2005


    Net revenues in 2006 were $33.8 billion, 34% higher than in
    2005. Principal transactions revenues in 2006 increased 99%, to
    $7.2 billion, due primarily to increased revenues from
    trading of fixed income, currency, commodity and equity products
    with the strongest increases coming from credit products,
    commodities and proprietary trading. Net interest profit in 2006
    was $4.2 billion, down 5% due primarily to the impact of
    rising rates on municipal and equity derivatives and increased
    interest expense from higher long-term borrowings and funding
    charges, partially offset by higher short- term interest rates
    on deposit spreads earned. Managed accounts and other fee-based
    revenues in 2006 were $6.3 billion, up 10%, reflecting the
    impact of net inflows into annuitized-revenue products as well
    as higher equity market values, partially offset by lower
    revenues from MLIM resulting from the BlackRock merger.
    Commission revenues in 2006 were $6.0 billion, up 13% due
    primarily to a global increase in client transaction volumes,
    particularly in listed equities and mutual funds. Investment
    banking revenues of $4.6 billion in 2006 increased 23% from
    2005 reflecting increases in both debt and equity origination
    revenues as well as increased strategic advisory revenues. Other
    revenues were $2.9 billion, up from $1.8 billion due
    primarily to higher revenues from our private equity investments.

 

    Compensation and benefits expenses were $16.9 billion in
    2006, up 37% from 2005, reflecting higher incentive compensation
    associated with increased net revenues, as well as higher
    staffing levels. Our 2006 compensation and benefit expenses also
    reflect the non-cash compensation expenses incurred in 2006 of
    $1.8 billion related to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R. Compensation and benefits expenses were
    49.9% of net revenues for 2006, as compared to 48.7% in 2005.
    Excluding the one-time impacts related to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R and the BlackRock merger, compensation
    and benefits were 47.0% of net revenues for 2006. See
    Exhibit 99.1, filed with our 2007
    10-K, for a
    reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.

 

    Non-compensation expenses were $7.1 billion in 2006, up 15%
    from 2005. Communications and technology costs were
    $1.8 billion, up 15% from 2005, due primarily to costs
    related to technology investments for growth, including
    acquisitions, and higher market information and communications
    costs. Brokerage, clearing and exchange fees were
    $1.1 billion, up 28% from 2005, mainly due to increased
    transaction volumes. Professional fees were $885 million,
    up 21% from 2005, reflecting higher legal and consulting fees
    primarily associated with increased business activity levels.
    Advertising and market development expenses were
    $686 million, up 16%

    from 2005, due primarily to higher travel expenses associated
    with increased business activity levels and increased sales
    promotion and advertising costs.

 

Income
    Taxes


    Income taxes from continuing operations for 2007 were a net
    credit of $4.2 billion, reflecting a tax benefit associated
    with the Companys pre-tax losses. Our 2007 effective tax
    rate from continuing operations was 32.7%, compared with an
    effective rate of 27.7% in 2006. The change in the effective tax
    rate reflected a tax benefit from carry-back claims that reduced
    the 2006 tax rate and the mix of business. Our 2006 effective
    tax rate of 27.7% compared with 28.8% in 2005 and reflected a
    $296 million reduction in the tax provision arising from
    carry-back claims covering the years 2001 and 2002. Our 2005 tax
    provision of $1.9 billion reflected the net impact of the
    business mix, tax settlements, and $97 million of tax
    associated with the repatriation of $1.8 billion of foreign
    earnings.

 










   Business
    Segments




    Our operations are currently organized into two business
    segments: GMI and GWM. GMI provides full service global markets
    and origination products and services to corporate,
    institutional, and government clients around the world. GWM
    creates and distributes investment products and services for
    individuals, small- and mid-size businesses, and employee
    benefit plans. For information on the principal methodologies
    used in preparing the segment results, refer to Note 2 of
    the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    The following segment results represent the information that is
    relied upon by management in its decision-making processes.
    These results exclude corporate items. Prior year business
    segment results are restated to reflect reallocations of
    revenues and expenses that result from changes in our business
    strategy and organizational structure. Revenues and expenses
    associated with inter-segment activities are recognized in each
    segment. In addition, revenue and expense sharing agreements for
    joint activities between segments are in place, and the results
    of each segment reflect their
    agreed-upon
    apportionment of revenues and expenses associated with these
    activities. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further information. Segment results are
    presented from continuing operations and exclude results from
    discontinued operations. Refer to Note 17 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
    discontinued operations.

 

    Results for the year ended December 29, 2006 include
    one-time compensation expenses, as follows: $1.4 billion in
    GMI, $281 million in GWM and $109 million in MLIM;
    refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further information on one-time compensation expenses.

GMIs 2007
    Developments


    During 2007, GMI recorded negative net revenues and a pre-tax
    loss, as record net revenues from Equity Markets and Investment
    Banking were more than offset by net losses in FICC. The FICC
    business was adversely impacted by a challenging market
    environment, particularly in the second half of the year. The
    combination of the deterioration in the credit markets, a
    decline in liquidity, reduced price transparency, increased
    volatility, and a weak U.S. housing market had a materially
    negative impact on our global credit and global structured
    finance and investments businesses within FICC.

 

    In FICC, many of our businesses away from U.S. ABS CDO and
    U.S. sub-prime continued to perform well. Our global rates
    and global currencies businesses both had record years, as we
    continued to strengthen these businesses with incremental
    headcount and infrastructure. Additionally, we continued to
    broaden the scope of the global commodities business in terms of
    product, geography, and linkage to the broader client franchise,
    including trading in oil and metals and geographically in the
    Pacific Rim.

 

    On December 24, 2007, we announced that we had reached an
    agreement to sell most of Merrill Lynch Capital, a wholly owned
    middle market commercial financing business within FICC to GE
    Capital. This transaction reflects our continued strategic focus
    on divesting non-core assets and optimizing capital allocation
    across businesses. The sale was completed on February 4,
    2008.

    In Equity Markets, we continued to enhance our leading cash
    equity trading platform by adding to our portfolio and
    electronic trading capabilities through additional investments
    in personnel and technology. We also made progress in our global
    equity-linked trading business, another key area of investment
    by expanding our product groups in Europe and the Pacific Rim.
    Our global markets financing and services business, which
    includes prime brokerage, continued to expand its products to
    include additional synthetic offerings. The strategic risk
    group, our distinct proprietary trading business, also continued
    investments in personnel and infrastructure that provided the
    capabilities to take risk when market opportunities arose. We
    also continued to make significant new investments in our global
    private equity business, expand globally and leverage our global
    investment banking coverage. Overall, our equity business
    continued to strengthen its linkages with our GWM business.

 

    In Investment Banking, we continued to expand our origination
    and advisory capabilities, adding to our global headcount in a
    targeted manner to improve the breadth and depth of our client
    franchise. During 2007, we focused on strengthening our
    footprint in emerging markets. In addition to traditional
    underwriting and advisory services, we also increasingly
    provided clients with integrated, multi-faceted solutions that
    span geographies, asset classes and products such as private
    equity, derivatives and commodities. We made significant
    progress increasing linkages with our GWM business.

    N/M = Not Meaningful

 

    GMIs 2007 net revenues were negative
    $2.7 billion, down significantly from the record net
    revenues recorded in 2006. Pre-tax loss from continuing
    operations was $16.3 billion, compared to record earnings
    from continuing operations of $5.3 billion in the
    prior-year period. The 2007 loss was primarily driven by net
    write-downs of $20.6 billion related to U.S. ABS CDOs and
    sub-prime mortgages and securities, and $2.6 billion
    related to increased credit valuation adjustments against
    financial guarantor counterparties related to U.S. ABS
    CDOs. GMIs 2007 net revenues also included a gain of
    approximately $1.9 billion due to the impact of the
    widening of Merrill Lynchs credit spreads on the carrying
    value of certain of our long-term liabilities.

 

    GMIs 2006 net revenues were $18.3 billion, up
    36% from the prior year. Pre-tax earnings of $5.3 billion
    and pre-tax profit margin of 28.9% included $1.4 billion in
    one-time compensation expenses incurred in the first quarter of
    2006. Excluding these one-time compensation expenses, pre-tax
    earnings for 2006 were $6.7 billion, up 43% from the prior
    year, and the pre-tax profit margin was 36.4%, compared to 34.8%
    in 2005. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further detail on the one-time compensation
    expenses. See Exhibit 99.1, filed with our 2007
    Form 10-K,
    for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. GMIs growth in
    net revenues and pre-tax earnings in 2006 were a result of
    increased revenues in FICC, Equity Markets and Investment
    Banking.

 

Fixed Income,
    Currencies and Commodities (FICC)


    FICC net revenues include principal transactions and net
    interest profit (which we believe should be viewed in aggregate
    to assess trading results), commissions, revenues from principal
    investments, and other revenues.





  
  
  
  
  




 


 


    page 41


 












Table of Contents


    For 2007, FICC net revenues were negative $15.9 billion as
    strong revenues in global rates and global currencies were more
    than offset by declines in global credit and global structured
    finance and investments businesses, as discussed below.
    FICCs 2007 net revenues include a net benefit of
    approximately $1.2 billion related to changes in our credit
    spreads on the carrying value of certain of our long-term
    liabilities.

 

    During 2007, FICC was adversely impacted by the deterioration in
    the credit markets evidenced by lower levels of liquidity,
    reduced price transparency, increased volatility and a weaker
    U.S. housing market. The combination of these market
    conditions resulted in approximately $20.6 billion of net
    write-downs in 2007 related to our U.S. ABS CDOs, as well
    as our U.S. sub-prime residential mortgage-related assets
    including whole loans, warehouse lending, residual positions,
    residential mortgage-backed securities and sub-prime related
    securities held in our U.S. banks investment securities
    portfolio. FICC net revenues also included credit valuation
    adjustments related to our hedges with financial guarantors of
    negative $3.1 billion including negative $2.6 billion
    related to U.S. super senior ABS CDOs. These amounts
    reflect the write-down of our current exposure to a
    non-investment grade counterparty from which we had purchased
    hedges covering a range of asset classes including
    U.S. super senior ABS CDOs.

 

    To a lesser extent, FICC net revenues were also impacted by
    write-downs related to our corporate and financial sponsor,
    non-investment grade lending commitments and write-downs related
    to commercial real estate exposures.

 

    Partially offsetting these losses were strong performances in
    our global rates and global currencies businesses, which were up
    77% and 36%, respectively, compared to the prior year. Our rates
    business benefited from strong client flow in interest rate
    swaps and options and was well positioned to take advantage of
    increases in both market and interest rate volatility. We also
    generated strong results from both the flow derivative and
    short-term interest rate trading businesses. Our global
    currencies business performed well in all regions, where we were
    well positioned to take advantage of favorable market
    conditions, increased volatility and increased client flow. Our
    global commodities business results were down 26% from the prior
    year due to limited trading opportunities in commodity markets.

 

    In 2006, FICC net revenues of $7.6 billion increased 30%
    from 2005, as net revenues increased for all major products. The
    increases in net revenues were primarily driven by record
    year-over-year results in global commodities, global credit,
    global currencies, and global commercial real estate.

 

Equity
    Markets


    Equity Markets net revenues include commissions, principal
    transaction revenues and net interest profit (which we believe
    should be viewed in aggregate to assess trading results),
    revenues from equity method investments, changes in fair value
    on private equity investments, and other revenues.

 

    For 2007, Equity Markets net revenues were a record
    $8.3 billion, up 23% from the prior year period, driven by
    our equity-linked business which was up nearly 80%, global cash
    equity trading business which was up over 30% and global markets
    financing and services business, which includes prime brokerage,
    which was up over 45%. Results in our global cash equity trading
    business were driven by volume growth in our electronic trading
    business, which increased 90% over 2006. Equity prime broker
    balances increased over 50% from 2006. Our equity-linked
    business increased over 2006 due to client related activities in
    structured products and index options. These increases in Equity
    Markets net revenues for the year more than offset a
    year-over-year decline in net revenues from our global private
    equity business of $1.2 billion, driven primarily by the
    decline in the value of our publicly traded investments. Equity
    Markets 2007 net revenues include a gain of approximately
    $700 million related to changes in the carrying value of
    certain of our long-term liabilities.

 

    Equity Markets net revenues in 2006 of $6.7 billion
    increased 54% from 2005 with positive results across every major
    line of business. The increase in revenues was primarily driven
    by global private equity, the strategic risk group, global
    equity-linked trading and the global markets equity financing
    and services business, which includes prime brokerage.

 

Investment
    Banking


    For 2007, Investment Banking net revenues were a record
    $4.9 billion, up 22% from the prior-year period. The
    increases in strategic advisory services and equity origination,
    more than offset a decline in debt origination revenues.

 

Origination


    Origination revenues represent fees earned from the underwriting
    of debt, equity and equity-linked securities as well as loan
    syndication fees.

 

    For 2007, origination revenues were $3.2 billion, up 9%
    from 2006. Equity origination revenues were up 34% compared with
    2006, while debt origination revenues were down 9%. The increase
    in revenues for equity origination compared to the prior-year
    period was primarily related to an increase in deal volume for
    the first half of 2007, partially offset by the industry-wide
    slowdown in activity during the second half of 2007. Debt
    origination experienced similar trends with deal volume
    increasing for the first half of 2007, while the industry-wide
    slowdown in activity during the second half of 2007 more than
    offset the increases in the first half of the year.

    In 2007 we purchased approximately $3 billion of perpetual
    convertible preferred shares issued by a key client, in a
    non-strategic capital markets transaction that enabled the
    client to raise funds to retire a previously issued series of
    preferred stock. We intend to hold this investment for a
    substantial period of time and to utilize appropriate risk
    management techniques to limit the impact of the change in value
    of the securities on our financial position and results of
    operations. The revenues associated with this transaction have
    been included in GMIs equity origination and equity
    markets businesses and recorded in principal transactions in the
    accompanying Consolidated Statement of (Loss)/Earnings for the
    year ended December 28, 2007.

 

    Origination revenues in 2006 were $2.9 billion, up 23% from
    2005, driven by increased overall origination activity and our
    improved market share during 2006. Debt origination revenues set
    a new record at $1.7 billion, increasing 20% from 2005.

 

Strategic
    Advisory Services


    The firms 2007 strategic advisory services revenues, which
    include merger and acquisition and other advisory fees,
    increased 58% from the year-ago period, to $1.7 billion, on
    increased overall deal volume as well as an increase in our
    share of completed merger and acquisition volume. Revenues for
    the year included our role as sole advisor to the consortium
    including The Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis and Banco Santander
    on their acquisition of ABN AMRO.

 

    Strategic advisory services revenues were $1.1 billion in
    2006, up 25% from 2005 on increased transaction volumes.

Investment
    Brokerage and Advisory Services


    We provide comprehensive brokerage and advisory financial
    services in the United States to GPC clients principally through
    our FA network. Outside the United States, we provide
    comprehensive brokerage and investment services and related
    products through a network of offices located in 35 countries.
    We also offer banking and trust services, as well as investment
    management services, to our clients in many countries.

 

    To be more responsive to our clients needs and to enhance
    the quality of our clients experience, GPC offers a
    multi-channel service model that more closely aligns our FAs
    with clients based on levels of investable assets. The FAs focus
    primarily on clients with more than $100,000, but less than
    $10 million of investable assets. Private Wealth Advisors
    who have completed a rigorous accreditation program focus
    primarily on clients with more than $10 million of
    investable assets. GPCs Financial Advisory Center, a
    team-based service platform with client access by telephone and
    internet, is focused primarily on U.S. clients with less
    than $100,000 of investable assets. GPC also uses International
    Financial Advisory Centers to more effectively serve
    non-U.S. clients
    with lower levels of investable assets.

 

    To help align products and services to each clients
    specific investment requirements and goals, GPC offers a choice
    of traditional commission-based investment accounts, a variety
    of asset-priced investment advisory services and self-directed
    online accounts. Assets in GPC accounts totaled $1.75 trillion
    at December 28, 2007, an 8% increase from December 29,
    2006, due primarily to net new money and market appreciation.

 

    Individual clients access the full range of GPC brokerage and
    advisory services through the Cash Management Account®
    (CMA®), a product that combines investment and
    cash management transactions, as well as Visa® cards, check
    writing and ATM access. At the end of 2007, there were
    approximately 2.3 million CMA® accounts with aggregate
    assets of approximately $809 billion. Small- and medium-

Global Investment
    Management


    GIM creates and manages various investment products for clients.
    GIMs results include revenues derived from those
    activities, as well as our share of earnings from our ownership
    positions in other investment management companies, including
    our investment in BlackRock.

 

Alternative
    Investments


    Through its alternative investments business, GIM creates and
    manages a broad array of alternative investment choices for
    clients. Unlike traditional investments such as mutual funds,
    whose performance is largely dependent on the direction of the
    broader market, many alternative investment strategies seek
    positive returns in any market or economic environment. Our
    alternative investments business offers a range of investment
    choices, including offering qualified
    high-net-worth
    clients access to a wide range of hedge fund strategies.

 

BlackRock


    We own a 45% voting interest and approximately half of the
    economic interest of BlackRock, which is one of the worlds
    largest publicly traded investment management firms with
    approximately $1.4 trillion in assets under management at the
    end of 2007. BlackRock manages assets on behalf of institutions
    and individuals worldwide through a variety of equity, fixed
    income, cash management, and alternative investment products.

 

GWMs 2007
    Developments


    GWM continued to focus on growth initiatives during 2007,
    driving operating leverage through a strategy of revenue and
    product diversification, annuitization, client segmentation,
    growth in client assets, the hiring of additional FAs, and
    investments to improve productivity. Approximately 860 FAs were
    added during 2007, and productivity per FA increased over 2006.
    The growth in FAs came through recruiting efforts and the
    continued low rate of turnover among our most productive FAs.
    GWM continues to make investments to carefully expand both
    within and outside the United States, where we believe
    substantial opportunity for growth exists in a number of markets.

 

    On September 21, 2007, we acquired all of the outstanding
    common shares of First Republic in exchange for a combination of
    cash and stock for a total transaction value of
    $1.8 billion. First Republic, which now operates as a
    division of Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Co. FSB,
    provides personalized, relationship-based banking services,
    including private banking, private business banking, real estate
    lending, trust, brokerage and investment management. The results
    of operations of First Republic have been included in GWM since
    the transaction closed. Refer to Note 16 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 

    On December 28, 2007, we sold MLIG to AEGON for
    $1.3 billion, which resulted in an after-tax gain of
    $316 million in discontinued operations. We will maintain a
    strategic business relationship with AEGON in the areas of
    insurance and investment products, and will

    GWMs net revenues in 2007 were $14.0 billion, an
    increase of 18% over the prior year, reflecting strong growth in
    both GPC and GIMs businesses. GWM generated
    $3.6 billion of pre-tax earnings from continuing
    operations, up 59% from the prior year. The pre-tax profit
    margin was 25.9% in 2007, compared with 19.3% in the prior year.
    Our share of the after-tax earnings of BlackRock is included in
    the GIM portion of GWM revenues for the full year of 2007, but
    for only the fourth quarter of 2006, as the BlackRock merger
    occurred on September 29, 2006.

 

    GWMs net revenues in 2006 were $11.8 billion, an
    increase of 13% over 2005, reflecting strong growth in both GPC
    and GIMs businesses, as well as the inclusion of our share
    of fourth quarter 2006 after-tax earnings of BlackRock. Pre-tax
    earnings were up 11% to $2.3 billion.

 

    Assets in annuitized-revenue products at year-end 2007 were
    $655 billion, up 7% from 2006, driven by both market
    appreciation and net inflows. Total client assets in GWM
    accounts ended the year at $1.75 trillion. Total net new money
    was $80 billion in 2007, up 33% from 2006. This was the
    highest full year net new money inflow in over six years and
    included higher than normal inflows into money funds and other
    low risk asset classes, consistent with clients seeking to
    reduce their risk exposure during the difficult second half of
    the year. GWMs net inflows of client assets into
    annuitized-revenue products were $38 billion in 2007, down
    21% from 2006 due to regulatory changes that resulted in our
    decision to no longer offer fee-based brokerage accounts.

 

    In March 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
    of Columbia Circuit held that the SEC exceeded its rulemaking
    authority with respect to
    Rule 202(a)(11)-1
    of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the Fee-Based
    Rule). The Fee-Based Rule generally exempted certain
    broker-dealers from the requirement to register as investment
    advisers under the Advisers Act with respect to the offering of
    fee-based brokerage services. In its decision, the court
    overturned the Fee-Based Rule in its entirety. During the third
    quarter of 2007, after review of this decision with
    representatives of the SEC, we informed clients of our decision
    to no longer offer our Merrill Lynch Unlimited Advantage®
    (MLUA) account, and our Financial Advisors worked
    with MLUA clients to transfer their assets to an alternative
    account platform. During the fourth quarter of 2007, more than
    $100 billion of client assets were transitioned from MLUA
    accounts into other account platforms with approximately 75%
    transitioning into other fee-based accounts. While the remaining
    25% of client assets migrated to traditional commission-based
    accounts, virtually no client assets were transferred outside of
    Merrill Lynch. Excluding the impact of the MLUA transition, net
    new money into annuitized-revenue products would have been over
    $20 billion higher in 2007. While this decision affected
    certain of our service offerings to certain clients, we do not
    expect it to have a material impact on our future financial
    results.

 

Global Private
    Client


    GPC generated record net revenues of $12.9 billion in 2007,
    up 14% from the prior year, as revenues increased in every major
    revenue category. GPCs net revenues were
    $11.3 billion in 2006, up 12% from the prior year. Both
    2007 and 2006 increases in net revenues were





  
  
  
  
  




 


 


    page 45


 












Table of Contents


    due to higher asset values and strong flows into fee-based
    products, as well as higher net interest profit and
    transactional and origination revenues.

 

    In 2007, GPC added a net of 860 FAs, driven by continued
    retention of current FAs and recruitment of new FAs, as GPC
    continued to successfully execute its strategy for recruiting
    and training high-quality FAs.

 

    A detailed discussion of GPCs revenues follows:

 

Fee-Based
    Revenues


    Fee-based revenues primarily consist of portfolio service fees
    that are derived from accounts that charge an annual fee based
    on net asset value (generally billed quarterly in advance based
    on prior quarter asset values), such as Merrill Lynch
    Consults® (a separately managed account product) and prior
    to 2007 year-end, Unlimited Advantage® (a fee-based
    brokerage account). Fee-based revenues also include commissions
    related to distribution fees on mutual funds, asset-based
    commissions from insurance products and taxable and tax-exempt
    money market funds, and fixed annual account fees and other
    account-related fees (these commissions are included in
    commissions revenues on the Consolidated Statements of
    (Loss)/Earnings).

 

    GPC generated a record $6.3 billion of fee-based revenues
    in 2007, up 14% from 2006. In 2006, fee-based revenues totaled
    $5.5 billion, up 16% from 2005. Both 2007 and 2006
    increases in fee-based revenues were due to higher market values
    and strong flows into annuitized-revenue products.

Transactional
    and Origination Revenues


    Transactional and origination revenues include certain
    commission revenues, such as those that arise from agency
    transactions in listed and OTC equity securities, mutual funds,
    and insurance products. These revenues also include principal
    transactions which primarily represent bid-offer revenues on
    government bonds and municipal securities, as well as new issue
    revenues which include selling concessions on newly issued debt
    and equity securities, including shares of closed-end funds.

 

    Transactional and origination revenues were $3.9 billion in
    2007, up 14% from 2006, primarily due to higher client
    transaction volumes in secondary markets, particularly outside
    the United States, as well as growth in origination activity
    across all products. In addition, transactional and origination
    revenues included $168 million related to the termination
    of various agreements under which we were no longer obligated to
    provide future support and informational services related to
    origination activities.

 

    Transactional and origination revenues were $3.4 billion in
    2006, up 4% from the prior year with increases in both
    transaction-related revenues and origination revenues.

 

Net Interest
    Profit and Related Hedges


    Net interest profit (interest revenues less interest expenses)
    and related hedges include GPCs allocation of the interest
    spread earned in our banking subsidiaries for deposits, as well
    as interest earned, net of provisions for loan losses, on
    securities-based loans, mortgages, small- and middle-market
    business and other loans, corporate funding allocations, and the
    interest component of non-qualifying derivatives.

 

    GPCs net interest profit and related hedges were
    $2.3 billion in 2007, up 10% from 2006, primarily due to
    higher net interest revenue from deposits and additional
    interest from First Republic since the date of acquisition on
    September 21, 2007. GPCs net interest profit and
    related hedges were $2.1 billion in 2006, up 19% from 2005.
    The 2006 increase primarily reflected higher margins on deposits
    resulting from rising short-term interest rates and lower
    provisions for loan losses associated with the small- and
    middle-market business loan portfolio.

 

Other
    Revenues


    GPCs other revenues were $416 million in 2007, up 38%
    from 2006, primarily due to additional revenues from the
    distribution of mutual funds and foreign exchange gains.

 

    GPCs other revenues were $301 million in 2006, down
    3% from 2005, due in part to lower mortgage-related revenues.

Global Investment
    Management


    GIM includes revenues from the creation and management of hedge
    fund and other alternative investment products for clients, as
    well as our share of net earnings from our ownership positions
    in other investment management companies, including BlackRock.
    Under the equity method of accounting, an estimate of the net
    earnings associated with our approximately 50% ownership
    interest in BlackRock is recorded in the GIM portion of the GWM
    segment.

 

    GIMs 2007 revenues of $1.1 billion were up 107% from
    2006, driven by the inclusion of revenues for a full year from
    our investment in BlackRock, and to a lesser extent increases in
    revenues from our investments in other alternative asset
    management companies. GIMs 2006 revenues of
    $541 million were up 32% from 2005, primarily due to the
    inclusion of revenues from our ownership position in BlackRock,
    as well as growth in revenues from our investments in other
    alternative asset management companies.

 

Merrill Lynch
    Investment Managers


    On September 29, 2006, we merged MLIM with BlackRock in
    exchange for a total of 65 million common and preferred
    shares in the newly combined BlackRock, representing an economic
    interest of approximately half. Following the merger, the MLIM
    business segment ceased to exist, and under the equity method of
    accounting, an estimate of the net earnings associated with our
    ownership position in BlackRock is recorded in the GIM portion
    of the GWM segment.

2006 results include only nine
    months of operations prior to the BlackRock merger at the end of
    the third quarter of 2006.
    


 

    MLIMs net revenues for 2006, reflecting only nine months
    of operations, increased 5% over those for the full year 2005,
    to $1.9 billion, driven by strong net sales and asset
    appreciation. Pre-tax earnings of $637 million, reflecting
    only nine months of operations, and pre-tax profit margin of
    33.5% included $109 million in one-time compensation
    expenses incurred in 2006. Excluding these one-time compensation
    expenses, pre-tax earnings were $746 million, increasing
    27% over the prior year, and the pre-tax profit margin was
    39.3%, up nearly 7 percentage points from 32.4% in 2005.
    Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further detail on the one-time compensation expenses. See
    Exhibit 99.1, filed with our 2007
    Form 10-K,
    for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.

 

Asset
    Management Fees


    Asset management fees primarily consisted of fees earned from
    the management and administration of retail mutual funds and
    separately managed accounts for retail investors, as well as
    institutional funds such as pension assets. Asset management
    fees also included performance fees, which are generated in some
    cases by separately managed accounts and institutional money
    management arrangements.

 

    Asset management fees for the first nine months of 2006 were
    $1.6 billion, down slightly from the full year revenues in
    2005, but up 37% from the first nine months of 2005, driven by
    strong net sales and asset appreciation.

 

Commissions


    Commissions for MLIM principally consisted of distribution fees
    and contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC) related
    to mutual funds. The distribution fees represented revenues
    earned for promoting and distributing mutual funds, and the CDSC
    represented fees earned when a shareholder redeemed shares prior
    to the required holding period. Commission revenues were
    $83 million for the first nine months of 2006, down 21%
    from the full year of 2005, but up 5% from the first nine months
    of 2005.

 

Other
    Revenues


    Other revenues primarily included net interest profit,
    investment gains and losses and revenues from consolidated
    investments. Other revenues totaled $257 million for the
    first nine months of 2006, up from $129 million for the
    full year of 2005 reflecting increased investment gains from
    consolidated investments.

    Our operations are organized into five regions which include:
    the United States; Europe, Middle East, and Africa
    (EMEA); Pacific Rim; Latin America; and Canada.
    Revenues and expenses are generally recorded based on the
    location of the employee generating the revenue or incurring the
    expense without regard to legal entity. The information that

2006 U.S. net revenues include a

2007 U.S. net revenues include
    write-downs of $23.2 billion related to U.S. ABS CDOs, U.S.
    sub-prime residential mortgages and securities, and credit
    valuation adjustments related to hedges with financial
    guarantors on U.S. ABS CDOs.
    


 

Non-U.S. net
    revenues for 2007 increased to a record $12.9 billion, up
    7% from 2006. This increase was mainly attributable to higher
    net revenues generated from the Pacific Rim and Latin America
    regions, partially offset by a decrease in EMEA. Growth in
    non-U.S. net
    revenues was generated across all major businesses in 2007. For
    GMI,
    non-U.S. net
    revenues increased 16% from the prior year. For GWM,
    non-U.S. net
    revenues increased 24% from 2006 and represented 11% of the
    total GWM net revenues.

 

    Net revenues in EMEA were $6.0 billion in 2007, a decrease
    of 13% from 2006, which included MLIM net revenues of
    approximately $775 million. The decrease from the prior
    year was also driven by lower net revenues from GMI, mainly
    within FICC. Within our FICC business, we experienced lower net
    revenues primarily driven by our structured finance and
    commercial real estate businesses. In addition, net revenues
    from our private equity business declined in 2007 by
    approximately $400 million compared to 2006. These
    decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues in our
    Equity Markets business reflecting strong performances from
    equity-linked, financing and services (which includes prime
    brokerage), and cash equities trading activities. Investment
    Banking net revenues increased from a year ago as increases from
    our strategic advisory services and equity origination
    activities more than offset declines in our debt origination.

 

    Net revenues in EMEA were $6.9 billion in 2006, up 45% from
    2005. This increase resulted from higher net revenues throughout
    GMI businesses. Within FICC, higher net revenues were driven by
    increases from commodities, credit related and structured
    finance activities, while Equity Markets strong results
    reflected increases from equity-linked and cash equities trading
    activities. Private equity net revenues increased over
    $200 million in 2006 compared to 2005. Investment Banking
    net revenues were higher across all areas with the strongest
    increase generated from debt origination.

 

    Net revenues in the Pacific Rim were $5.1 billion in 2007,
    an increase of 37% from 2006. These results reflected increases
    across multiple businesses and products within GMI and GWM.
    Within GMI, higher net revenues in Equity Markets were driven by
    our equity-linked and cash equities trading activities, while
    higher net revenues in FICC were primarily driven by commercial
    real estate. GWM net revenues rose 27% to over $500 million
    in 2007.

 

    Net revenues in the Pacific Rim were $3.7 billion in 2006,
    an increase of 38% from 2005, mainly reflecting growth across
    GMI businesses. In FICC, higher net revenues primarily reflected
    increases from our commercial real estate business as well as
    our rates and currency trading activities. Increased net
    revenues in Equity Markets were driven by cash equities trading
    activities and increased net revenues from our private equity
    business. Investment Banking net revenues increased across all
    activities with the most significant increase generated from
    equity origination.

 

    Net revenues in Latin America increased 39% in 2007, reflecting
    strong results in both our GMI and GWM businesses. In GMI, all
    businesses generated higher net revenues with the most
    significant increases resulting from FICC credit and currency
    trading activities.

 

    Net revenues in Canada increased 11% in 2007, due to strong
    results in our GMI businesses.

 

    U.S. net revenues were negative $1.6 billion in 2007,
    down from $21.8 billion in 2006, which included a
    $2.0 billion gain related to the BlackRock merger and
    approximately $900 million of net revenues from MLIM. The
    decreases were mainly driven by lower net revenues

Table of Contents


    in GMI, primarily within our FICC business. See the FICC results
    of operations section for further information. In Equity Markets
    net revenues increased in 2007 driven by increased gains of
    approximately $700 million arising from the widening of
    Merrill Lynch credit spreads on certain of our long-term
    liabilities and increases from equity-linked, financing and
    servicing and cash equities trading. Investment Banking net
    revenues increased year-over-year as strong strategic advisory
    and equity origination activities offset lower net revenues from
    debt origination, primarily leveraged finance. The overall
    decline in GMI net revenues was partially offset by strong
    results from our GWM business, which generated net revenues of
    $12.3 billion, an increase of 19% from 2006.

 

    In 2006, U.S. net revenues were $21.8 billion, which
    included the one-time gain arising from the merger of MLIM with
    BlackRock, increased 30% compared to 2005 reflecting increases
    across all GMI businesses and GWM. Equity Markets strong results
    in 2006 reflected increased net revenues from our private equity
    business and equity-linked trading activities. Investment
    Banking higher net revenues in 2006 reflected increases across
    all businesses, while FICCs increased net revenues in 2006
    were driven by credit trading activities. GWM generated net
    revenues of $10.4 billion in 2006, an increase of 14% from
    2005.

Averages represent our daily
    balance sheet estimates, which may not fully reflect netting and
    other adjustments included in period-end balances. Balances for
    certain assets and liabilities are not revised on a daily basis.
    


 

    The increases in trading-related assets and liabilities as of
    December 28, 2007, when compared to December 29, 2006, primarily
    reflect higher levels of securities financing activity, which
    includes increased client matched-book transactions. We
    continued to expand our prime brokerage business during the
    year, which resulted in increases in securities financing
    transactions.

 

    The increase in non-trading related assets as of December 28,
    2007, when compared to December 29, 2006, primarily relates to
    an increase in loans, notes, and mortgages and cash. The
    increase in loans, notes, and mortgages primarily relates to the
    origination of commercial loans, and to a lesser extent,
    residential mortgages, which included loans associated with our
    First Republic acquisition.





  
  
  
  
  




 


 


    page 49


 












Table of Contents


    The increase in cash is primarily driven by issuances of
    long-term borrowings. See the Cash Flows section in our
    MD&A for further details on changes in cash. Non-trading
    related liabilities were higher as of December 28, 2007, when
    compared to December 29, 2006,  primarily due to increases in
    long-term borrowings and deposits to maintain sufficient funding
    to support our businesses and ensure adequate liquidity.

 

    Stockholders equity at December 28, 2007 was
    $31.9 billion, down 18% from $39.0 billion at
    December 29, 2006. This decrease primarily resulted from
    our net loss from continuing operations, common stock
    repurchases, and dividends paid, which were partially offset by
    common and preferred stock issuances and the net effect of
    employee stock transactions.

 

    See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information on balance sheet captions.

 










   Off-Balance
    Sheet Exposures




    As a part of our normal operations, we enter into various off
    balance sheet arrangements that may require future payments. The
    table below outlines the significant off balance sheet
    arrangements, as well as the future expirations as of
    December 28, 2007:

Liquidity, Credit
    and Default Facilities


    We provide guarantees to special purpose entities
    (SPEs) in the form of liquidity, credit and default
    facilities. The liquidity, credit and default facilities relate
    primarily to municipal bond securitization SPEs, whose assets
    are comprised of municipal bonds, and an asset-backed commercial
    paper conduit, whose assets primarily include auto and equipment
    loans and lease receivables. To protect against declines in
    value of the assets held by the SPEs for which we provide
    liquidity, credit or default facilities, we may economically
    hedge our exposure through derivative positions that principally
    offset the risk of loss of these facilities. See Notes 6
    and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further
    information.

 

Residual Value
    Guarantees


    Residual value guarantees are primarily related to leasing SPEs
    where either we or a third-party is the lessee, and includes
    residual value guarantees associated with the Hopewell campus
    and aircraft leases of $322 million. At December 28,
    2007 a liability of $13 million was recorded on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet for these guarantees.

 

Standby Letters
    of Credit


    We also make guarantees to counterparties in the form of standby
    letters of credit and reimbursement agreements issued in
    conjunction with sales of loans originated under our Mortgage
    100| program. At December 28, 2007, we held
    $593 million of marketable securities as collateral to
    secure these guarantees and a liability of $12 million was
    recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 

Other
    Guarantees


    In conjunction with certain structured investment funds, we
    guarantee the return of the initial principal investment at the
    termination date of the fund. These funds are generally managed
    based on a formula that requires the fund to hold a combination
    of general investments and highly liquid risk-free assets that,
    when combined, will result in the return of principal at the
    maturity date unless there is a significant market event. At
    December 28, 2007 a liability of $7 million was
    recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for these guarantees.

 

    We also provide indemnifications related to the U.S. tax
    treatment of certain foreign tax planning transactions. The
    maximum exposure to loss associated with these transactions is
    $167 million; however, we believe that the likelihood of
    loss with respect to these arrangements is remote. At
    December 28, 2007 no liabilities were recorded on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet for these guarantees.

 

    In connection with residential mortgage loan and other
    securitization transactions, Merrill Lynch typically makes
    representations and warranties about the underlying assets. If
    there is a material breach of such representations and
    warranties, Merrill Lynch may have an obligation to repurchase
    the assets or indemnify the purchaser against any loss. For
    residential mortgage loan and other securitizations, the maximum
    potential amount that could be required to be repurchased is the
    current outstanding asset balance. Specifically related to First
    Franklin activities, there is currently approximately
    $40 billion of outstanding loans that First Franklin sold
    in various asset sales and securitization transactions over the
    last 36 months. Merrill Lynch has recognized a liability of
    approximately $520 million at December 28, 2007
    arising from these residential mortgage sales and securitization
    transactions.

Table of Contents


Derivatives


    Merrill Lynch records all derivative transactions at fair value
    on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Merrill Lynch does not
    monitor its exposure to derivatives based on the theoretical
    maximum payout because that measure does not take into
    consideration the probability of the occurrence. Additionally,
    the notional value is not a relevant indicator of Merrill
    Lynchs exposure to these contracts, as it is not
    indicative of the amount that will be owed on the contract.
    Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and
    establish limits to help to ensure that certain risk-related
    losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits. Since
    derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at
    fair value and the disclosure of the notional amounts is not a
    relevant indicator of risk, notional amounts are not provided
    for the off-balance sheet exposure on derivatives. Derivatives
    that meet the definition of a guarantee under FIN 45,
    Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
    Guarantees, Including Indebtedness of Others, are included
    in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    We also fund selected assets, including CDOs and CLOs, via
    derivative contracts with third party structures that are not
    consolidated on our balance sheets. Of the total notional amount
    of these total return swaps, approximately $24 billion is
    term financed through facilities provided by commercial banks,
    $35 billion of long term funding is provided by third party
    special purpose vehicles and $11 billion is financed with
    asset backed commercial paper conduits. In certain
    circumstances, we may be required to purchase these assets which
    would not result in additional gain or loss to us as such
    exposure is already reflected in the fair value of our
    derivative contracts.

 

    In order to facilitate client demand for structured credit
    products, we sell protection on high grade collateral and buy
    protection on lesser grade collateral to certain SPEs which then
    issue structured credit notes.

 

    Acting in our market making capacity, we enter into other
    derivatives with SPEs, both Merrill Lynch sponsored and third
    party, including interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and
    other derivative instruments.

 

Involvement
    with SPEs


    Merrill Lynch transacts with SPEs in a variety of capacities,
    including those that we help establish as well as those for
    which we are not involved in the initial formation. Merrill
    Lynchs involvement with SPEs can vary and, depending upon
    the accounting definition of the SPE (i.e., voting rights entity
    (VRE), VIE or QSPE), we may be required to reassess
    whether our involvement necessitates consolidating the SPE or
    disclosing a significant involvement with the SPE. An interest
    in a VRE requires reconsideration when our equity interest or
    management influence changes, an interest in a VIE requires
    reconsideration when an event occurs that was not originally
    contemplated (e.g., a purchase of the SPEs assets or
    liabilities), and an interest in a QSPE requires reconsideration
    if the entity no longer meets the definition of a QSPE. Refer to
    Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a
    discussion of our consolidation accounting policies. Types of
    SPEs include:

 






     

 Municipal bond securitization SPEs: SPEs that issue
    medium-term paper, purchase municipal bonds as collateral and
    purchase a guarantee to enhance the creditworthiness of the
    collateral.


 

     

 Asset-backed securities SPEs: SPEs that issue different
    classes of debt, from super senior to subordinated, and equity
    and purchase assets as collateral, including residential
    mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto leases and credit card
    receiveables.


 

     

 ABS CDOs: SPEs that issue different classes of debt, from
    super senior to subordinated, and equity and purchase
    asset-backed securities collateralized by residential mortgages,
    commercial mortgages, auto leases and credit card receivables.


 

     

 Synthetic CDOs: SPEs that issue different classes of
    debt, from super senior to subordinated, and equity, purchase
    high grade assets as collateral and enter into a portfolio of
    credit default swaps to synthetically create the credit risk of
    the issued notes.


 

     

 Credit-linked note SPEs: SPEs that issue notes
    linked to the credit risk of a company, purchase high grade
    assets as collateral and enter into credit default swaps to
    synthetically create the credit risk to pay the return on the
    notes.


 

     

 Tax planning SPEs: SPEs are sometimes used to legally
    isolate transactions for the purpose of deriving certain tax
    benefits on behalf of our clients as well as ourselves. The
    assets and capital structure of these entities vary for each
    structure.


 

     

 Trust preferred security SPEs: These SPEs hold junior
    subordinated debt issued by Merrill Lynch, or our subsidiaries,
    and issue preferred stock on substantially the same terms to
    third party investors. We also provide a parent guarantee, on a
    junior subordinated basis, of the distributions and other
    payments on the preferred stock to the extent that the SPEs have
    funds legally available. The debt we issue into the SPE is
    classified as long-term borrowings on our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. The ML & Co. parent guarantees of its own
    subsidiaries are not required to be recorded in the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.


 

     

 Conduits: Generally, entities that issue commercial paper
    and subordinated capital, purchase assets, and enter into total
    return swaps or repurchase agreements with higher rated
    counterparties, particularly banks. The Conduits generally have
    a liquidity
    and/or
    credit facility to further enhance the credit quality of the
    commercial paper issuance. A single seller conduit will execute
    total return swaps, repurchase agreements, and liquidity and
    credit facilities with one financial institution. A multi-seller
    conduit will execute total return swaps, repurchase agreements,
    and liquidity and credit facilities with numerous financial
    institutions. Refer to Notes 6 and 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for additional information on Conduits.

Table of Contents


    Our involvement with SPEs includes off-balance sheet
    arrangements discussed above, as well as the following
    activities:

 

Holder of Issued
    Debt and Equity


    Particularly in SPEs that we establish, Merrill Lynch may be the
    holder of debt and equity of an SPE. These holdings will be
    classified as trading assets, loans, notes and mortgages or
    investment securities. Such holdings may change over time at the
    discretion of Merrill Lynch and rarely are there contractual
    obligations requiring us to purchase additional debt or equity
    interests. Significant obligations would be disclosed in the off
    balance sheet arrangements table above.

 

Warehousing of
    Loans and Securities


    Warehouse loans and securities represent amounts maintained on
    our balance sheet that are intended to be sold into a trust for
    the purposes of securitization. We may retain amounts on our
    balance sheet for the benefit of a CDO managed by a third party.
    Warehoused loans are carried as held for sale and warehoused
    securities are carried as trading assets. We have significantly
    reduced the levels of activity and exposure to these holdings.

 

Securitizations


    In the normal course of business, Merrill Lynch securitizes:
    commercial and residential mortgage loans and home equity loans;
    municipal, government, and corporate bonds; and other types of
    financial assets. Securitizations involve the selling of assets
    to SPEs, which in turn issue debt and equity securities
    (tranches) with those assets as collateral. Merrill
    Lynch may retain interests in the securitized financial assets
    through holding tranches of the securitization. See Note 6
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

Structured
    Investment Vehicles (SIVs)


    SIVs are leveraged investment programs that purchase securities
    and issue asset-backed commercial paper and medium-term notes.
    These SPEs are characterized by low equity levels with partial
    liquidity support facilities and the assets are actively managed
    by the SIV investment manager. Merrill Lynch  has not been the
    sponsor or equity investor of any SIV. Merrill Lynch has acted
    as a commercial paper or medium-term note placement agent for
    various SIVs.

    Obligations and Commitments



 










   Contractual
    Obligations
    




    In the normal course of business, we enter into various

Relates to estimates of future
    interest payments associated with long-term borrowings based
    upon applicable interest rates as of December 28, 2007.
    Excludes estimates of stated coupons, if any, on structured
    notes given the difficulty in predicting the value of the
    underlying.
    


 

    We issue U.S. dollar and
    non-U.S. dollar-denominated
    long-term borrowings with both variable and fixed interest
    rates, as part of our overall funding strategy. For further
    information on funding and long-term borrowings, see the Capital
    and Funding section in our MD&A and Note 9 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. In the normal course of
    business, we enter into various noncancellable long-term
    operating lease agreements, various purchasing commitments,
    commitments to extend credit and other commitments. For detailed
    information regarding these commitments, see Note 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    As disclosed in Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, Merrill Lynch has unrecognized tax benefits as of
    December 28, 2007 of approximately $1.5 billion in
    accordance with FIN 48. Of this total, approximately
    $1.2 billion (net of federal benefit of state issues,
    competent authority and foreign tax credit offsets) represents
    the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized,
    would favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods.
    As indicated in Note 14, unrecognized tax benefits with
    respect to the U.S. Tax Court case and the Japanese
    assessment, while paid, have been included in the
    $1.5 billion and the $1.2 billion amounts above. Due
    to the uncertainty of the amounts to be ultimately paid as well
    as the timing of such payments, all FIN 48 liabilities
    which have not been paid have been excluded from the Contractual
    Obligations table.

   Capital
    and Funding




    The primary objectives of our capital management and funding
    strategies are as follows:

 






     

    Maintain sufficient long-term capital to support the execution
    of our business strategies and to achieve our financial
    performance objectives;


 

     

    Ensure liquidity across market cycles and through periods of
    financial stress; and


 

     

    Comply with regulatory capital requirements.



 










   Long-Term
    Capital
    




    Our long-term capital sources include equity capital, long-term
    borrowings and certain deposits in bank subsidiaries that we
    consider to be long-term or stable in nature.

 

    At December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006 total
    long-term capital consisted of the following:

    At December 28, 2007, our long-term capital sources of
    $288.9 billion exceeded our estimated long-term capital
    requirements. In addition, on a pro forma basis for equity
    issuances completed subsequent to year-end and described on
    page 54, our pro forma long-term capital was
    $297.9 billion. See Liquidity Risk in the Risk Management
    Section for additional information.

 










   Equity
    Capital
    




    At December 28, 2007, equity capital, as defined by Merrill
    Lynch, was $36.7 billion and comprised of
    $27.5 billion of common equity, $4.4 billion of
    preferred stock, and $4.7 billion of trust preferred
    securities. We define equity capital more broadly than
    stockholders equity under U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles, as we include other capital instruments
    with equity-like characteristics such as trust preferred
    securities. We view trust preferred securities as equity capital
    because they are either perpetual or have maturities of at least
    50 years at issuance. These trust preferred securities
    represent junior subordinated notes, net of related investments.
    Junior subordinated notes (related to trust preferred
    securities) are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
    liabilities for accounting purposes. The related investments are
    reported as investment securities on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

 

    We regularly assess the adequacy of our equity capital base
    relative to the estimated risks and needs of our businesses, the
    regulatory and legal capital requirements of our subsidiaries,
    standards required by the SECs CSE rules and capital
    adequacy methodologies of rating agencies. At December 28,
    2007 Merrill Lynch was in compliance with applicable CSE
    standards. Refer to Note 15 to the

Table of Contents


    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
    regulatory requirements. We also assess the impact of our
    capital structure on financial performance metrics.

 

    We have developed economic capital models to determine the
    amount of equity capital we need to cover potential losses
    arising from market, credit and operational risks. These models
    align closely with our regulatory capital requirements. We
    developed these statistical risk models in conjunction with our
    risk management practices, and they allow us to attribute an
    amount of equity to each of our businesses that reflects the
    risks of that business, both on- and off-balance sheet. We
    regularly review and periodically refine models and other tools
    used to estimate risks, as well as the assumptions used in those
    models and tools to provide a reasonable and conservative
    assessment of our risks across a stressed market cycle. We also
    assess the need for equity capital to support risks that we
    believe may not be adequately measured through these risk models.

 

    In addition, we consider how much equity capital we may need to
    support normal business growth and strategic initiatives. In the
    event that we generate common equity capital beyond our
    estimated needs, we seek to return that capital to shareholders
    through share repurchases and dividends, considering the impact
    on our financial performance metrics. Likewise, we will seek to
    raise additional equity capital to the extent we determine it
    necessary.

 

    Major components of the changes in our equity capital for 2007
    and 2006 are as follows:

    Our equity capital of $36.7 billion at December 28,
    2007 decreased $5.7 billion, or 13%, from December 29,
    2006. Equity capital decreased in 2007 primarily as a result of
    net losses, common stock repurchases and dividends. The equity
    capital decrease was partially offset by the issuance of common
    stock, the net issuance of preferred stock and trust preferred
    securities and the net effect of employee stock transactions. On
    a pro forma basis for equity issuances completed subsequent to
    year-end and described below, we had $45.6 billion of pro
    forma equity capital which was comprised of $29.9 billion
    in common equity, $11.0 billion in preferred stock and
    $4.7 billion in trust preferred securities.

 

Common
    Stock


    On December 24, 2007, we reached agreements with each of
    Temasek and Davis, on behalf of various investors, to sell an
    aggregate of 116.7 million shares of newly issued common
    stock at a price of $48.00 per share, for aggregate proceeds of
    approximately $5.6 billion. Temasek purchased
    55 million shares in December 2007 and the remaining
    36.7 million shares in January 2008. In addition, Temasek
    and its assignees exercised options to purchase an additional
    12.5 million shares of our common stock at a purchase price
    of $48.00 per share in February 2008. Davis purchased
    25 million shares in December 2007. See Other
    Information (Unaudited)  Unregistered Sales of Equity
    Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity
    Securities for additional detail on these transactions.

 

    Upon closing the First Republic acquisition on
    September 21, 2007, we issued 11.6 million shares of
    common stock as a portion of the consideration.

 

    On January 18, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a 40%
    increase in the regular quarterly dividend to 35 cents per
    common share.

 

    During 2007, we repurchased 62.1 million common shares at
    an average repurchase price of $84.88 per share. On
    April 30, 2007 the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of an additional $6 billion of our outstanding
    common shares. During 2007, we had completed the $5 billion
    repurchase program authorized in October 2006 and had
    $4.0 billion of authorized repurchase capacity remaining
    under the repurchase program authorized in April 2007. We did
    not repurchase any common stock during the fourth quarter of
    2007 and do not anticipate additional repurchases of common
    shares.

 

Preferred
    Stock


    On January 15, 2008, we reached agreements with several
    long-term investors to sell an aggregate of 66,000 shares
    of newly issued 9.00% Non-Voting Mandatory Convertible
    Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1.00
    per share and liquidation preference $100,000 per share (the
    Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock), at a price
    of $100,000 per share, for an aggregate

    purchase price of approximately $6.6 billion. We issued the
    Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock on various dates in
    January and February 2008. See Other Information
    (Unaudited)  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities,
    Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
    for additional detail on these transactions.

 

    In conjunction with the acquisition of First Republic on
    September 21, 2007 we issued $65 million of 6.70%
    non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and $50 million of
    6.25% non-cumulative preferred stock in exchange for First
    Republics preferred stock Series A and B,
    respectively.

 

    On March 20, 2007, Merrill Lynch issued $1.5 billion
    of floating rate, non-cumulative, perpetual preferred stock.

 

Trust Preferred
    Securities


    On March 30, 2007, Merrill Lynch Preferred Capital
    Trust II redeemed all of the outstanding $300 million
    of 8.00% trust preferred securities.

 

    On May 2, 2007, Merrill Lynch Capital Trust II issued
    $950 million of 6.45% trust preferred securities and
    invested the proceeds in junior subordinated notes issued by
    ML & Co.

 

    On August 22, 2007, Merrill Lynch Capital Trust III
    issued $750 million of 7.375% trust preferred securities
    and invested the proceeds in junior subordinated notes issued by
    ML & Co.

 

    The table below sets forth the information with respect to
    purchases made by or on behalf of us or any affiliated
    purchaser of our common stock during the year ended

   Balance
    Sheet Leverage
    




    Assets-to-equity leverage ratios are commonly used to assess a
    companys capital adequacy. We believe that a leverage
    ratio adjusted to exclude certain assets considered to have low
    risk profiles and assets in customer accounts financed primarily
    by customer liabilities provides a more meaningful measure of
    balance sheet leverage in the securities industry than an
    unadjusted ratio. We calculate adjusted assets by reducing total
    assets by (1) securities financing transactions and
    securities received as collateral less trading liabilities net
    of derivative contracts and (2) segregated cash and
    securities and separate accounts assets.

 

    As leverage ratios are not risk sensitive, we do not rely on
    them to measure capital adequacy. When we assess our capital
    adequacy, we consider more sophisticated measures that capture
    the risk profiles of the assets, the impact of hedging,
    off-balance sheet exposures, operational risk, regulatory
    capital requirements and other considerations.

 

    The following table provides calculations of our leverage ratios
    at December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006:

    Issuance of 49.2 million shares of common stock for
    $2.4 billion during the first quarter of 2008 in connection
    with our agreement with Temasek;


 

     

    Issuance of 66,000 shares of our 9.00% Non-Voting Mandatory
    Convertible Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1
    (convertible into a maximum of 126 million shares of common
    stock) for approximately $6.6 billion during the first
    quarter of 2008 to long-term investors, including the Korea
    Investment Corporation, Kuwait Investment Authority and Mizuho
    Corporate Bank; and


 

     

    On a pro forma basis for equity issuances completed subsequent
    to year-end and described above, our pro forma leverage ratio,
    adjusted leverage ratio and tangible adjusted leverage ratio
    would have been 22.6x, 14.4x, and 16.1x, respectively.

   Funding
    




    We fund our assets primarily with a mix of secured and unsecured
    liabilities through a globally coordinated funding strategy. We
    fund a portion of our trading assets with secured liabilities,
    including repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other
    short-term secured borrowings, which are less sensitive to our
    credit ratings due to the underlying collateral. A portion of
    our short-term borrowings are secured under a master note
    lending program. These notes are similar in nature to other
    collateralized financing sources such as securities sold under
    agreements to repurchase. Refer to Note 9 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
    regarding our borrowings.

    Our primary funding objectives are maintaining sufficient
    funding sources to support our existing business activities and
    future growth while ensuring that we have liquidity across
    market cycles and through periods of financial stress. To
    achieve our objectives, we have established a set of funding
    strategies that are described below:

 






     

    Diversify funding sources;


 

     

    Maintain sufficient long-term borrowings;


 

     

    Concentrate unsecured funding at ML & Co.;


 

     

    Use deposits as a source of funding; and


 

     

    Adhere to prudent governance principles.



 

Diversification
    of Funding Sources


    We strive to diversify and expand our funding globally across
    programs, markets, currencies and investor bases. We issue debt
    through syndicated U.S. registered offerings,
    U.S. registered and unregistered medium-term note programs,
    non-U.S. medium-term
    note programs,
    non-U.S. private
    placements, U.S. and
    non-U.S. commercial
    paper and through other methods. We distribute a significant
    portion of our debt offerings through our retail and
    institutional sales forces to a large, diversified global
    investor base. Maintaining relationships with our investors is
    an important aspect of our funding strategy. We also make
    markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for
    investors.

 

    At December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006 our total
    short- and long-term borrowings were issued in the following
    currencies:

Includes various other foreign

    issuances.
    


 

    We also diversify our funding sources by issuing various types
    of debt instruments, including structured notes. Structured
    notes are debt obligations with returns that are linked to other
    debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities.
    We typically hedge these notes with positions in derivatives
    and/or in
    the underlying instruments. We could be required to immediately
    settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other
    securities under certain circumstances, which we take into
    account for liquidity planning purposes. Structured notes
    outstanding were $59.0 billion and $33.8 billion at
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively.

Table of Contents


    Extendible notes are debt obligations that provide the holder an
    option to extend the note monthly but not beyond the stated
    final maturity date. These notes are included in the long-term
    borrowings while the time to the stated final maturity is
    greater than one year. Total extendible notes outstanding were
    $1.8 billion and $11.4 billion at December 28,
    2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively. Consistent with
    the market environment for this type of security, the majority
    of extendible notes holders elected not to extend their
    notes maturity during the second half of 2007. The amount
    that has not been extended is included in the current portion of
    long-term borrowings.

 

Maintenance of
    Sufficient Long-Term Borrowings


    An important objective of our asset-liability management is
    maintaining sufficient long-term borrowings to meet our
    long-term capital requirements. As such, we routinely issue debt
    in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost
    efficient funding and an appropriate maturity profile. While the
    cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively
    impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to
    the financial services industry or Merrill Lynch, we seek to
    mitigate this refinancing risk by actively managing the amount
    of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any one
    month or quarter.

 

    At December 28, 2007, the weighted average maturity of our
    long-term borrowings exceeded four years. The following chart
    presents our long-term borrowings maturity profile as of
    December 28, 2007 (quarterly for two years and annually
    thereafter):

    Subordinated debt is an important component of our long-term
    borrowings. During 2007, ML & Co. issued
    $4.4 billion of subordinated debt in multiple currencies
    with maturities ranging from 2017 to 2037. This subordinated
    debt was issued to satisfy certain anticipated CSE capital
    requirements. All of ML & Co.s subordinated debt
    is junior in right of payment to ML & Co.s
    senior indebtedness.

 

    At December 28, 2007, senior and subordinated debt issued
    by ML & Co. or by subsidiaries and guaranteed by
    ML & Co., including short-term borrowings, totaled
    $250.5 billion. Except for the $2.2 billion of
    zero-coupon contingent convertible debt (Liquid Yield Option

Table of Contents


    or LYONs®) outstanding at December 28,
    2007 and the three-year multi-currency, unsecured bank facility
    discussed in Committed Credit Facilities, senior and
    subordinated debt obligations issued by ML & Co. and
    senior debt issued by subsidiaries and guaranteed by
    ML & Co. do not contain provisions that could, upon an
    adverse change in ML & Co.s credit rating,
    financial ratios, earnings, cash flows, or stock price, trigger
    a requirement for an early repayment, additional collateral
    support, changes in terms, acceleration of maturity, or the
    creation of an additional financial obligation. See Note 9
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    information.

 

    We use derivative transactions to more closely match the
    duration of borrowings to the duration of the assets being
    funded, thereby enabling interest rate risk to be within limits
    set by our Market Risk Management group. Interest rate swaps
    also serve to convert our interest expense and effective
    borrowing rate principally to floating rate. We also enter into
    currency swaps to hedge assets that are not financed through
    debt issuance in the same currency. We hedge investments in
    subsidiaries in
    non-U.S. dollar
    currencies in whole or in part to mitigate foreign exchange
    translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
    See Notes 1 and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further information.

 

Concentration of
    Unsecured Funding at ML & Co.


    ML & Co. is the primary issuer of all unsecured,
    non-deposit financing instruments that we use predominantly to
    fund assets in subsidiaries, some of which are regulated. The
    primary benefits of this strategy are greater control, reduced
    funding costs, wider name recognition by investors, and greater
    flexibility to meet variable funding requirements of
    subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences, or other
    business considerations make this impractical, certain
    subsidiaries enter into their own financing arrangements.

 

Deposit
    Funding


    At December 28, 2007, our global bank subsidiaries had
    $104.0 billion in customer deposits, which provide a
    diversified and stable base for funding assets within those
    entities. Our U.S. deposit base of $76.6 billion
    includes an estimated $59.7 billion of FDIC-insured
    deposits, which we believe are less sensitive to our credit
    ratings. We predominantly source deposit funding from our
    customer base in the form of our bank sweep programs and time
    deposits. In addition, the acquisition of First Republic has
    further diversified and enhanced our bank subsidiaries deposit
    funding base.

 

    Deposits are not available as a source of funding to
    ML & Co. See Liquidity Risk in the Risk
    Management section for more information regarding our
    deposit liabilities.

 

Prudent
    Governance


    We manage the growth and composition of our assets and set
    limits on the overall level of unsecured funding. Funding
    activities are subject to regular senior management review and
    control through Asset/Liability Committee meetings with treasury
    management and other independent risk and control groups.
    Through 2007 our funding strategy and practices were reviewed by
    the Risk Oversight Committee (ROC), our executive
    management and the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.
    In 2008, the responsibility of the ROC in this regard has been
    assumed by the Regulatory Oversight and Controls Committee.

 

Credit
    Ratings


    Our credit ratings affect the cost and availability of our
    unsecured funding, and it is our objective to maintain high
    quality credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings are
    important when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to
    engage in certain long-term transactions, including OTC
    derivatives. Factors that influence our credit ratings include
    the credit rating agencies assessment of the general
    operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in
    which we compete, our reputation, level and volatility of our
    earnings, our corporate governance and risk management policies,
    and our capital management practices.

 

    The following table sets forth ML & Co.s
    unsecured credit ratings as of February 15, 2008. Rating
    agencies express outlooks from time to time on these credit
    ratings. Ratings from Fitch Ratings, Moodys Investor
    Service, Inc., and Standard & Poors Ratings
    Services reflect one-notch downgrades from those agencies on
    October 24, 2007. Rating outlooks from those agencies
    remain negative, where they were placed on October 5, 2007.
    Also, on October 24, 2007, Dominion Bond Rating Service
    Ltd. affirmed the Companys ratings and outlook as stable.
    On December 7, 2007, Rating & Investment
    Information, Inc. (Japan) downgraded the Companys
    long-term and subordinated debt ratings. The outlook on these
    ratings remains negative, where they were placed on
    October 25, 2007. Following our announcement of fourth
    quarter and full-year 2007 results on January 17, 2008, all
    five agencies affirmed their ratings and outlooks.

    In connection with certain OTC derivatives transactions and
    other trading agreements, we could be required to provide
    additional collateral to or terminate transactions with certain
    counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt
    ratings of ML & Co. The amount of additional
    collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a
    fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the
    exposure. At December 28, 2007, the amount of additional
    collateral and termination payments that would be required for
    such derivatives transactions and trading agreements was
    approximately $4 billion in the event of a one-notch
    downgrade and approximately an additional $670 million in
    the event of a two-notch downgrade of ML & Co.s
    long-term senior debt credit rating. Our liquidity risk analysis
    considers the impact of additional collateral outflows due to
    changes in ML & Co. credit ratings as well as for
    collateral that is owed by us and is available for payment, but
    has not been called for by our counterparties.

 

Cash
    Flows


    Our previously issued Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for
    the fiscal years ended December 29, 2006 and
    December 30, 2005 were restated to correct an overstatement
    of cash used for operating activities and a corresponding
    overstatement of cash provided by financing activities. Refer to
    Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information. This restatement has been reflected in the
    following discussion.

 

    Cash and cash equivalents of $41.3 billion at year-end 2007
    increased by $9.2 billion from 2006. Cash flows from
    financing activities provided $88.7 billion during 2007,
    primarily due to issuances and resales of long-term borrowings,
    net of settlements and repurchases of $71.8 billion, cash
    from deposits of $9.9 billion and cash from the issuance of
    common stock of $4.8 billion, offset by common stock
    repurchases of $5.3 billion. Cash flows used for investing
    activities during 2007 were $7.1 billion and were primarily
    due to net cash used for available-for-sale securities of
    $5.6 billion and other investments of $5.0 billion,
    offset by loans held for investment. Cash flows used for
    operating activities during 2007 were $72.4 billion and
    were primarily due to net cash used for resale agreements and
    securities borrowed transactions and net cash used for loans,
    notes and mortgages held for sale, partially offset by cash
    provided by trading liabilities, repurchase agreements and
    securities loaned transactions.

 

    Our cash and cash equivalents increased $17.5 billion to
    $32.1 billion at year-end 2006. Cash flows from financing
    activities provided $52.3 billion in 2006, primarily due to
    the issuances and resales of long-term borrowings, net of
    settlements and repurchases, of $45.3 billion and cash from
    commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $9.1 billion.
    Cash flows used for investing activities in 2006 were
    $11.0 billion and were primarily due to purchases of
    available-for-sale securities, net of sales and maturities, of
    $2.0 billion, and cash used for other investments of
    $6.5 billion. Cash flows used for operating activities in
    2006 were $23.8 billion and were primarily due to net cash
    used for trading assets and liabilities of $45.8 billion,
    offset by increases in customer payables of $13.8 billion.

 










   Risk
    Management



 










   Risk
    Management Philosophy
    




    Risk-taking is integral to the core businesses in which we
    operate. In the course of conducting our business operations, we
    are exposed to a variety of risks including market, credit,
    liquidity, operational and other risks that are material and
    require comprehensive controls and ongoing oversight. Senior
    managers of our core businesses are responsible and accountable
    for management of the risks associated with their business
    activities. In addition, independent risk groups monitor market
    risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and operational risk.

 

    We have taken a number of steps to reinforce a culture of
    disciplined risk-taking. First, in September 2007, we integrated
    the independent control functions of market and credit risk in
    the new Global Risk Management group under a single Chief Risk
    Officer, the former head of Global Credit and Commitments, who
    now reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. Within
    Global Risk Management, we have combined the Credit and Market
    Risk teams in order to take a more integrated approach to the
    risks of each business. In addition, in January 2008, we
    announced the hiring of a senior, experienced risk professional
    who will join Merrill Lynch as co-Chief Risk Officer. The
    co-Chief Risk Officers will report jointly to the Chief
    Executive Officer. Global Treasury, which manages liquidity
    risk, and the Operational Risk Group, which manages operational
    risk, continue to fall under the management responsibility of
    our Chief Financial Officer.

 

    Second, in January 2008, our Chief Executive Officer established
    a weekly risk meeting attended by the heads of the trading
    businesses, the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Financial Officer,
    and a Vice Chairman (the Weekly Risk Review). At
    this Weekly Risk Review, updates from the businesses and Global
    Risk Management on risk-related matters are provided with
    particular attention paid to risk concentrations, liquidity
    concerns, efficient balance sheet usage and strategic
    risk-return considerations.

    Global Risk Management, Global Treasury and Operational Risk
    Management work to ensure risks are properly identified,
    measured, monitored, and managed throughout Merrill Lynch
    together with other independent control groups, including
    Corporate Audit, Finance and the Office of General Counsel. To
    accomplish this, we have established a risk management process
    that includes:

 






     

    A risk governance structure that defines the responsibilities of
    the independent groups that monitor risk and the oversight
    activities of the board committees, the Regulatory Oversight and
    Controls Committee and Weekly Risk Review;







  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report

Table of Contents







     

    A regular review of the risk management process by the Audit
    Committee of the Board of Directors (the Audit
    Committee) as well as a regular review of credit, market
    and liquidity risks and processes by the Finance Committee of
    the Board of Directors (the Finance Committee);


 

     

    Clearly defined risk management policies and procedures
    supported by a rigorous analytical framework;


 

     

    Communication and coordination among the businesses, executive
    management, and risk functions while maintaining strict
    segregation of responsibilities, controls, and oversight; and


 

     

    Clearly articulated risk tolerance levels, which are included
    within the framework established by Global Risk Management and
    are consistent with our business strategy, capital structure,
    and current and anticipated market conditions.



 

    Independent risk and control groups interact with the core
    businesses to establish and maintain this overall risk
    management control process. We are reinforcing risk management
    control processes to ensure that our risk tolerance is
    well-defined and understood by our businesses as well as by our
    executive management. In particular, we are working to ensure
    that all material single-name, sector and product concentrations
    are appropriately recognized and managed. We are undertaking
    efforts to ensure that all highly correlated risks across
    different products and strategies are appropriately aggregated
    and monitored. We are also paying special attention to ensure
    that the risks taken by any business are well proportioned to
    its earnings potential. While no risk management system can ever
    be absolutely complete, the goal of these independent risk and
    control group processes is to mitigate risk-related losses so
    that they fall within acceptable, predefined levels, under
    foreseeable scenarios. Overall, these enhancements include
    improvements to our methodologies and changes in risk management
    and governance structure that are intended to bring experience
    and seasoned judgment to risk management decisions.

 










   Risk
    Governance Structure
    




    Our risk governance structure is comprised of the Audit
    Committee and the Finance Committee of the Board, the
    Regulatory, Oversight and Controls Committee, the business
    units, the independent risk and control groups, various other
    corporate governance committees as well as the active management
    of risk issues by senior management at the Weekly Risk Review.
    In 2008 the responsibilities that were held by the former Risk
    Oversight Committee (the ROC) through 2007 were
    assumed by Global Risk Management, the newly established
    Regulatory Oversight and Controls Committee and the Weekly Risk
    Review. This structure is intended to provide more effective
    management of risk by senior business managers and Global Risk
    Management jointly and clearer accountability within the risk
    governance structure.

 

Board of
    Directors Committees


    At the Board level, two committees are responsible for oversight
    of the management of the risks and risk policies and procedures
    of the firm. The Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of
    independent directors, oversees managements policies and
    processes for managing all major categories of risk affecting
    the firm, including operational, legal and reputational risks
    and managements actions to assess and control such risks.
    The Finance Committee, which is also composed entirely of
    independent directors, reviews the firms policies and
    procedures for managing exposure to market, credit and liquidity
    risk in general and, when appropriate, reviews significant risk
    exposures and trends in these categories of risk. Both the Audit
    Committee and the Finance Committee are provided with regular
    risk updates from management and the independent control groups.

 

Senior Management
    and Weekly Risk Review


    Senior Managers discuss and review regular updates on a variety
    of risk related matters in the Weekly Risk Review. Particular
    attention is paid to risk concentrations, liquidity concerns,
    efficient balance sheet usage and strategic risk-return
    considerations. Risk tolerance levels established by Global Risk
    Management are also reviewed by senior management in the context
    of the Weekly Risk Review as necessary.

 

Global Risk
    Management


    Global Risk Management establishes our market and credit risk
    tolerance levels, which are represented in part by framework
    limits.  These limits are presented periodically to the Weekly
    Risk Review for Senior Managers review. Risk framework
    exceptions and violations are reported and investigated at
    predefined levels of management.

 

Risk Oversight
    Committee (ROC)


    Through 2007, the ROC, which was comprised of senior business
    and control managers and chaired by our Chief Financial Officer
    and Chief Risk Officer, was charged with establishing risk
    tolerance levels for the firm and authorizing material changes
    to our risk profile. The ROCs mandate was to monitor the
    risks that we assumed and confirm they were managed within the
    established tolerance levels and to verify that appropriate
    processes were in place to identify, measure, monitor and manage
    our risks.

 

    Despite the foregoing, losses on U.S. sub-prime residential
    mortgage-related exposures and U.S. ABS CDOs in 2007 reflected a
    significant concentration in securities that accumulated as a
    result of our activities as a leading underwriter of CDOs. Our
    stress tests and other risk measures significantly
    underestimated the magnitude of actual loss from the
    unprecedented credit market environment over

Table of Contents


    the second half of 2007, in particular the extreme dislocation
    that affected U.S. sub-prime residential mortgage-related
    and U.S. ABS CDO positions. In addition to actions taken in
    2007, we continue to pursue opportunities to reduce our
    remaining exposure to these instruments but options to do so are
    limited due to the current illiquidity of the market for these
    assets. See U.S. ABS CDO and Other Mortgage Related
    Activities on page 34.

 

Regulatory
    Oversight and Controls Committee (ROCC) and Other
    Governance Committees


    We are establishing the Regulatory Oversight and Controls
    Committee in 2008 to oversee management procedures and controls
    related to risk, including the frameworks for managing market,
    credit, and operational risks, internal audit plans and
    information technology controls. The ROCC will oversee the
    activities of a number of additional existing governance
    committees, including new product, transaction review, and
    monitoring and oversight committees, that create policy, review
    activity, and verify that new and existing business initiatives
    remain within established risk tolerance levels. Representatives
    of the independent risk and control groups participate as
    members of these committees along with members from the
    businesses. The ROCC will report periodically to the Audit
    Committee of the Board.

 

    We will continue to take risk as appropriate and expand
    risk-taking judiciously where there are clear opportunities and
    where the business skill-set is in place to manage and
    understand the risk and its changing nature. Business lines will
    continue to have responsibility and accountability for managing
    the risk, and we will continue to deepen capabilities in a
    number of areas. In addition, we believe that the high level of
    focus on risk by our Chief Executive Officer and other senior
    managers, the additional senior management resources in the form
    of dedicated co-Chief Risk Officers, the integration of the
    credit and market risk functions, and our emphasis on
    reinforcing a culture of disciplined risk taking are enhancing
    our capacity to monitor the associated risk levels and
    conformity to corporate risk guidelines and risk tolerance
    levels.

 










   Market
    Risk
    




    We define market risk as the potential change in value of
    financial instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates,
    exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads,
    and/or other
    risks.

 

    Global Risk Management and other independent risk and control
    groups are responsible for approving the products and markets in
    which we transact and take risk. Moreover, Global Risk
    Management is responsible for identifying the risks to which
    these business units will be exposed in these approved products
    and markets. Global Risk Management uses a variety of
    quantitative methods to assess the risk of our positions and
    portfolios. In particular, Global Risk Management quantifies the
    sensitivities of our current portfolios to changes in market
    variables. These sensitivities are then utilized in the context
    of historical data to estimate earnings and loss distributions
    that our current portfolios would have incurred throughout the
    historical period. From these distributions, Global Risk
    Management derives a number of useful risk statistics, including
    value at risk (VaR) which are used to measure and
    monitor market risk exposures in our trading portfolios.

 

    VaR is a statistical measure of the potential loss in the fair
    value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk
    factors. We have a Risk Framework that is designed to define and
    communicate our market risk tolerance and broad overall limits
    across Merrill Lynch by defining and constraining exposure to
    specific asset classes, market risk factors and VaR.

 

    The VaR disclosed in the accompanying table (excluding
    U.S. sub-prime residential ABS CDO net exposures) is an
    estimate of the amount that our current trading portfolios could
    lose with a specified degree of confidence, over a given time
    interval. To calculate VaR, we aggregate sensitivities to market
    risk factors and combine them with a database of historical
    market factor movements to simulate a series of profits and
    losses. The level of loss that is exceeded in that
    series 5% of the time is used as the estimate for the 95%
    confidence level VaR. The overall VaR amounts are presented
    across major risk categories, which include exposure to
    volatility risk found in certain products, such as options.

 

    The calculation of VaR requires numerous assumptions and thus
    VaR should not be viewed as a precise measure of risk. Rather,
    it should be evaluated in the context of known limitations.
    These limitations include but are not limited to the following:

 






     

    VaR measures do not convey the magnitude of extreme events;


 

     

    Historical data that forms the basis of VaR may fail to predict
    current and future market volatility; and


 

     

    VaR does not fully reflect the effects of market illiquidity
    (i.e., the inability to sell or hedge a position over a
    relatively long period).



 

    To complement VaR and in recognition of its inherent
    limitations, we use a number of additional risk measurement
    methods and tools as part of our overall market risk management
    process. These include stress testing and event risk analysis,
    which examine portfolio behavior under significant adverse
    market conditions including scenarios that may result in
    material losses for Merrill Lynch. As a result of the
    unprecedented credit market environment during 2007, in
    particular the extreme dislocation that affected
    U.S. sub-prime residential mortgage-related and ABS CDO
    positions, VaR, stress testing and other risk measures
    significantly underestimated the

magnitude of actual loss.
    Historically, these AAA rated ABS CDO securities had not
    experienced a significant loss of value. We are committed to the
    continuous development of additional risk measurement methods to
    date and plan to continue our investment in their development in
    light of recent market experience. Nevertheless, we also
    recognize that no risk metrics will exhaust the range of
    potential market stress events and, therefore, management will
    engage in a process of continuous re-evaluation of our
    approaches to risk based on experience and judgment.
    

 

    The table that follows presents our average and year-end VaR for
    trading instruments for 2007 and 2006. Additionally, high and
    low VaR for 2007 is presented independently for each risk
    category and overall. Because high and low VaR numbers for these
    risk categories may have occurred on different days, high and
    low numbers for diversification benefit would not be meaningful.

 

    The aggregate VaR for our trading portfolios is less than the
    sum of the VaRs for individual risk categories because movements
    in different risk categories occur at different times and,
    historically, extreme movements have not occurred in all risk
    categories simultaneously. In addition, the difference between
    the sum of the VaRs for individual risk categories and the VaR
    calculated for all risk categories is shown in the following
    table and may be viewed as a measure of the diversification
    within our portfolios.

 

    Given the market experiences of U.S. sub-prime residential
    ABS CDO and residual securities, the modeling of these positions
    using traditional VaR measures is of limited interpretive value
    due to the known limitations of VaR enumerated above and the
    illiquidity of the positions themselves. Therefore, for 2007,
    the scope of the portfolio covered by the trading VaR has been
    changed to exclude the U.S. sub-prime residential ABS CDO
    and residual securities positions. The excluded positions are
    those shown in the U.S. ABS CDO net exposures and losses
    table on page 37 and the residuals line item in the
    U.S. sub-prime residential mortgage-related net exposures
    and losses table on page 35.

    Daily average VaR (excluding U.S. sub-prime residential ABS
    CDO and residual securities) was higher in 2007 than in 2006 due
    to growth in risk exposures in all risk categories. The increase
    was accentuated by an increase in the volatility of several
    major markets during the second half of 2007 (which is captured
    in the historical data used to calculate trading VaR).

 

    If U.S. sub-prime residential ABS CDO and residual
    securities positions were included under traditional VaR
    treatment, the daily average VaR for 2007 would have been
    $83 million and the 2007 year-end VaR would have been
    $157 million due to the increase in volatility of the
    sub-prime residential indices used to model the excluded
    positions. However, as noted, we believe that the application of
    traditional VaR techniques is not reflective of the true levels
    of risk in these positions.

 

    The histogram below shows the distribution of daily net revenues
    from our trading businesses (principal transactions and net
    interest profit) for 2007 excluding U.S. sub-prime ABS CDO
    and residual securities.

Non-Trading
    Market Risk


    Non-trading market risk includes the risks associated with
    certain non-trading activities, including investment securities,
    securities financing transactions and certain equity and
    principal investments. Interest rate risks related to funding
    activities are also included; however, potential gains and
    losses due to changes in credit spreads on the firms own
    funding instruments are excluded. Risks related to lending
    activities are covered separately in the Counterparty Credit
    Risk section that follows.

 

    The primary market risk of non-trading investment securities and
    repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements is expressed as
    sensitivity to changes in the general level of credit spreads,
    which are defined as the differences in the yields on debt
    instruments from relevant LIBOR/Swap rates. Non-trading
    investment securities include securities that are classified as
    available-for-sale and held-to-maturity. At the end of 2007, the
    total credit spread sensitivity of these instruments was a
    pre-tax loss of $24 million in economic value for an
    increase of one basis point, which is one one-hundredth of a
    percent, in credit spreads, which is unchanged from that at the
    end of 2006. This change in economic value is a measurement of
    economic risk which may differ significantly in magnitude and
    timing from the actual profit or loss that would be realized
    under generally accepted accounting principles.

 

    The interest rate risk associated with the non-trading
    positions, together with funding activities, is expressed as
    sensitivity to changes in the general level of interest rates.
    Our funding activities include LYONs®, trust preferred
    securities and other long-term debt issuances together with
    interest rate hedges. At the end of 2007, the net interest rate
    sensitivity of these positions is a pre-tax loss in economic
    value of $1 million for a parallel one basis point increase
    in interest rates across all yield curves, compared to
    $2 million at the end of 2006. This change in economic
    value is a measurement of economic risk which may differ
    significantly in magnitude and timing from the actual profit or
    loss that would be realized under generally accepted accounting
    principles.

 

    Other non-trading equity investments include direct private
    equity interests, private equity fund investments, hedge fund
    interests, certain direct and indirect real estate investments
    and other principal investments. These investments are broadly
    sensitive to general price levels in the equity or commercial
    real estate markets as well as to specific business, financial
    and credit factors which influence the performance and valuation
    of each investment uniquely. Refer to Note 5 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on
    these investments.

 










   Counterparty
    Credit Risk
    




    We define counterparty credit risk as the potential for loss
    that can occur as a result of an individual, counterparty or
    issuer being unable or unwilling to honor its contractual
    obligations to us. The Credit Risk Framework is the primary tool
    that we use to communicate firm-wide credit limits and monitor
    exposure by constraining the magnitude and tenor of exposure to
    counterparty and issuer families. Additionally, we have country
    risk limits that constrain total aggregate exposure across all
    counterparties and issuers (including sovereign entities) for a
    given country within predefined tolerance levels.

 

    Global Risk Management assesses the creditworthiness of existing
    and potential individual clients, institutional counterparties
    and issuers, and determines firm-wide credit risk levels within
    the Credit Risk Framework among other tools. This group reviews
    and monitors specific transactions as well as portfolio and
    other credit risk concentrations both within and across
    businesses. This group is also responsible for ongoing
    monitoring of credit quality and limit compliance and actively
    works with all of our business units to manage and mitigate
    credit risk.

 

    Global Risk Management uses a variety of methodologies to set
    limits on exposure and potential loss resulting from an
    individual, counterparty or issuer failing to fulfill its
    contractual obligations. The group performs analyses in the
    context of industrial, regional, and global economic trends and
    incorporates portfolio and concentration effects when
    determining tolerance levels. Credit risk limits take into
    account measures of both current and potential exposure as well
    as potential loss and are set and monitored by broad risk type,
    product type, and maturity. Credit risk mitigation techniques
    include, where appropriate, the right to require initial
    collateral or margin, the right to terminate transactions or to
    obtain collateral should unfavorable events occur, the right to
    call for collateral when certain exposure thresholds are
    exceeded, the right to call for third party guarantees and the
    purchase of credit default protection. With senior management
    involvement, we conduct regular portfolio reviews, monitor
    counterparty creditworthiness, and evaluate potential
    transaction risks with a view toward early problem
    identification and protection against unacceptable
    credit-related losses. We continue to invest additional
    resources to enhance Merrill Lynchs methods and policies
    to assist in managing our credit risk and to address evolving
    regulatory requirements.

 

    Senior members of Global Risk Management chair various
    commitment committees with membership across business, control
    and support units. These committees review and approve
    commitments, underwritings and syndication strategies related to
    debt, syndicated loans, equity, real estate and asset-based
    finance, among other products and activities.

Commercial
    Lending


    Our commercial lending activities consist primarily of corporate
    and institutional lending, asset-based finance, commercial
    finance, and commercial real estate related activities. In
    evaluating certain potential commercial lending transactions, we
    use a risk-adjusted-return-on-capital model in addition to other
    methodologies. We typically provide corporate and institutional
    lending facilities to clients for general corporate purposes,
    backup liquidity lines, bridge financings, and
    acquisition-related activities. We often syndicate corporate and
    institutional loans through assignments and participations to
    unaffiliated third parties. While these facilities may be
    supported by credit enhancing arrangements such as property
    liens or claims on operating assets, we generally expect
    repayment through other sources including cash flow
    and/or
    recapitalization. As part of portfolio management activities,
    Global Risk Management mitigates certain exposures in the
    corporate and institutional lending portfolio by purchasing
    single name and index credit default swaps as well as by
    evaluating and selectively executing loan sales in the secondary
    markets.

 

    Asset-based finance facilities are typically secured by
    financial assets such as mortgages, auto loans, leases, credit
    card and other receivables. Clients often use these facilities
    for the origination and purchase of assets during a warehousing
    period leading up to securitization. Credit assessment for these
    facilities relies primarily on the amount, asset type, quality,
    and liquidity of the supporting collateral, as the collateral is
    the expected source of repayment. Limits are monitored against
    potential loss upon default taking these factors into
    consideration.

 

    Our commercial finance activities primarily consist of corporate
    finance, healthcare finance, equipment finance and commercial
    real estate lending to qualifying business clients.
    Substantially all of these facilities are secured by liens on
    property, plant, and equipment, third party guarantees or other
    similar arrangements. Our other commercial real estate related
    activities consist of commercial mortgage originations and other
    extensions of credit connected to the financing of commercial
    properties or portfolios of properties. We may reduce these
    exposures through third-party syndications or securitizations.
    Our assessment of creditworthiness and credit approval is highly
    dependent upon the anticipated performance of the underlying
    property
    and/or
    associated cash flows.

 

    On December 24, 2007 we announced that we had reached an
    agreement with GE Capital to sell substantially all of Merrill
    Lynch Capitals operations, including its commercial real
    estate division. This transaction closed on February 4,
    2008. Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information.

 

    The following tables present a distribution of commercial loans
    and closed commitments by credit quality, industry and country
    for year-end 2007, gross of allowances for loan losses and
    credit valuation adjustments, without considering the impact of
    purchased credit protection. Closed commitments represent the
    unfunded portion of existing commitments available for draw down
    and do not include contingent commitments extended but not yet
    closed.

    As of December 28, 2007, our largest commercial lending
    industry concentration was to consumer goods and services.
    Commercial borrowers were predominantly domiciled in the United
    States or had principal operations tied to the United States or
    its economy. The majority of all outstanding commercial loan
    balances had a remaining maturity of less than five years.
    Additional detail on our commercial lending related activities
    can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

 

Residential
    Mortgage Lending


    We originate and purchase residential mortgage loans, certain of
    which include features that may result in additional credit risk
    when compared to more traditional types of mortgages. In
    connection with the acquisition of First Franklin on
    December 30, 2006, Merrill Lynch acquired sub-prime
    mortgage loans and originated a significant volume of sub-prime
    mortgage loans during the first half of 2007. As the year
    developed, delinquencies and defaults in the sub-prime mortgage
    loan market increased significantly leading to tighter
    underwriting criteria for new mortgages. As a result, First
    Franklin substantially reduced its sub-prime lending activities
    and currently is only making loans that are underwritten to
    prime underwriting criteria. The majority of First
    Franklins loans were sold either through whole loans or
    securitizations and are not reflected on Merrill Lynchs
    Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 28, 2007. In
    addition, Merrill Lynch acquired loans that have these features
    in connection with the acquisition of First Republic (see
    Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The
    additional credit risk arising from these mortgages is addressed
    first through adherence to underwriting guidelines. These
    guidelines are established within the business units and
    monitored by Global Risk Management. Credit risk is closely
    monitored in order to ensure that valuation adjustments are
    sufficient and valuations are appropriate. The majority of these
    loans held in loans, notes and mortgages include:

 






     

    Loans where the borrower is subject to potential payment
    increases over the life of the loan including:



 







 
     


    Interest-only loans where the borrower makes no principal
    payments on the loan during an initial period and is required to
    make both interest and principal payments either during the
    later stages of the loan or in one lump sum at maturity. These
    loans therefore require the borrower to make larger payments
    later in the life of the loans if the loans are not otherwise
    repaid through a refinancing or sale of the property. These
    loans are underwritten based on a variety of factors including,
    for example, the borrowers credit history, income, the
    debt-to-income ratio, disposable income and cash reserves, and
    the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on the property,
    typically using a qualifying formula that conforms to the
    guidance issued by the federal banking agencies with respect to
    non-traditional mortgage loans. In instances where the borrower
    is of lower credit standing, the loans are typically
    underwritten to have a lower LTV ratio
    and/or other
    mitigating factors. Interest-only loans comprise the significant
    majority of loans that we hold where the borrower may be subject
    to payment increases.


 

 
     


    Loans with low rates early in the loan term. The loans are
    underwritten based on the borrowers ability to make the
    principal and interest payments, and borrowers of a lower credit
    standing are typically underwritten to a lower LTV ratio.



 






     

    High LTV ratio loans where the principal amount of the loan is
    greater than 80% of the value of the mortgaged property and the
    borrower is not required to obtain private mortgage insurance
    (PMI),
    and/or loans
    where a mortgage and home equity loan are simultaneously
    established for the same property. Under our current policy, the
    maximum LTV ratio for originated residential mortgages with no
    PMI or other security is 85%, which can on an exception basis be
    extended to 90%. High LTV ratio loans also include Merrill
    Lynchs Mortgage100| product. The Mortgage100| product
    permits borrowers to pledge eligible securities in lieu of a
    cash down payment. The securities are subject to daily
    monitoring and additional collateral is required if the value of
    the pledged securities declines below certain levels. The
    net LTV ratio on real estate collateral in the Mortgage
    100| program typically does not exceed 70% including the pledge.

    residential mortgage loans with low LTV ratios that were
    acquired or originated in connection with the acquisition of
    First Republic.

Total residential mortgages were
    $26.9 billion and unfunded commitments were
    $7.0 billion as of December 28, 2007.
    



(3)
    


Includes loans from securitizations
    where due to Merrill Lynchs inability to sell certain
    securities disqualified the VIEs as QSPEs thereby resulting in
    Merrill Lynch having to consolidate the VIEs. Merrill
    Lynchs exposure is limited to (i) any retained
    interest and (ii) the representations and warranties made
    upon securitizations (See Note 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements).
    


 

    Approximately 56% of the high LTV ratio loans in the table above
    were made to borrowers in the United States; the majority of the
    remaining loans were made to borrowers in the United Kingdom.
    Approximately 89% of the loans where the borrower is subject to
    payment increase were made to borrowers in the United States;
    the majority of the remaining loans were made to borrowers in
    the United Kingdom.

 

Derivatives


    We enter into International Swaps and Derivatives Association,
    Inc. (ISDA) master agreements or their equivalent
    (master netting agreements) with substantially all
    of our derivative counterparties as soon as possible. Master
    netting agreements provide protection in bankruptcy in certain
    circumstances and, in some cases, enable receivables and
    payables with the same counterparty to be offset for risk
    management purposes. Agreements are negotiated bilaterally and
    can require complex terms. While we make reasonable efforts to
    execute such agreements, it is possible that a counterparty may
    be unwilling to sign such an agreement and, as a result, would
    subject us to additional credit risk. The enforceability of
    master netting agreements under bankruptcy laws in certain
    countries or in certain industries is not free from doubt, and
    receivables and payables with counterparties in these countries
    or industries are accordingly recorded on a gross basis.

 

    In addition, to reduce the risk of loss, we require collateral,
    principally cash and U.S. Government and agency securities,
    on certain derivative transactions. From an economic standpoint,
    we evaluate risk exposures net of related collateral that meets
    specified standards.

 

    The following is a summary of counterparty credit ratings for
    the replacement cost (net of $19.4 billion of collateral,
    of which $13.5 billion represented cash collateral) of OTC
    trading derivatives in a gain position by maturity at
    December 28, 2007.

    In addition to obtaining collateral, we attempt to mitigate our
    default risk on derivatives whenever possible by entering into
    transactions with provisions that enable us to terminate or
    reset the terms of our derivative contracts.

 










   Liquidity
    Risk
    




    We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet
    financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come
    due. Liquidity risk relates to the ability of a company to repay
    short-term borrowings with new borrowings or with assets that
    can be quickly converted into cash while meeting other
    obligations and continuing to operate as a going concern. This
    is particularly important for financial services firms.
    Liquidity risk also includes both the potential inability to
    raise funding with appropriate maturity, currency and interest
    rate

Table of Contents


    characteristics and the inability to liquidate assets in a
    timely manner at a reasonable price. We actively manage the
    liquidity risks in our business that can arise from
    asset-liability mismatches, credit sensitive funding,
    commitments or contingencies.

 

    The Liquidity Risk Management Group is responsible for
    measuring, monitoring and controlling our liquidity risks. This
    group establishes methodologies and specifications for measuring
    liquidity risks, performs scenario analysis and liquidity stress
    testing, and sets and monitors liquidity limits. The group works
    with our business units to limit liquidity risk exposures and
    reviews liquidity risks associated with products and business
    strategies. The Liquidity Risk Management Group also reviews
    liquidity risk with other independent risk and control groups
    and Treasury Management in Asset/Liability Committee meetings.

 

    Our primary liquidity objectives are to ensure liquidity through
    market cycles and periods of financial stress and to ensure that
    all funding requirements and unsecured debt obligations that
    mature within one year can be met without issuing new unsecured
    debt or requiring liquidation of business assets. In managing
    liquidity, we place significant emphasis on monitoring the near
    term cash flow profiles and exposures through extensive scenario
    analysis and stress testing. To achieve our objectives, we have
    established a set of liquidity management practices that are
    outlined below:

 






     

    Maintain excess liquidity in the form of unencumbered liquid
    assets and committed credit facilities;


 

     

    Match asset and liability profiles appropriately;


 

     

    Perform scenario analysis and stress testing; and


 

     

    Maintain a well formulated and documented contingency funding
    plan, including access to lenders of last resort.



 

Excess Liquidity
    and Unencumbered Assets


    Consistent with our objectives, we maintain excess liquidity at
    ML & Co. and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash
    and high quality unencumbered liquid assets, which represent our
    Global Liquidity Sources and serve as our primary
    source of liquidity risk protection. We maintain these sources
    of liquidity at levels we believe are sufficient to sustain
    Merrill Lynch in the event of stressed liquidity conditions. In
    assessing liquidity, we monitor the extent to which the
    unencumbered assets are available as a source of funds, taking
    into consideration any regulatory or other restrictions that may
    limit the availability of unencumbered assets of subsidiaries to
    ML & Co. or other subsidiaries.

 

    As of December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, the
    aggregate Global Liquidity Sources were $200 billion and
    $178 billion, respectively, consisting of the following:

    The excess liquidity pool is maintained at, or readily available
    to, ML & Co. and can be deployed to meet cash outflow
    obligations under stressed liquidity conditions. The excess
    liquidity pool includes cash and cash equivalents, investments
    in short-term money market mutual funds, U.S. government
    and agency obligations and other liquid securities. In the first
    quarter of 2007, we changed our investment strategy and
    eliminated our exposure to long-term fixed rate assets. At
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, the total
    carrying value of the excess liquidity pool, net of related
    hedges, was $79 billion and $63 billion, respectively,
    which included liquidity sources at subsidiaries that we believe
    are available to ML & Co. without restrictions. We
    regularly test our ability to access components of our excess
    liquidity pool. We fund our excess liquidity pool with debt that
    has an appropriate term maturity structure. Additionally, our
    policy is to fund at least $15 billion of our excess
    liquidity pool with debt that has a remaining maturity of at
    least one year. At December 28, 2007, the amount of our
    excess liquidity pool funded with debt with a remaining maturity
    of at least one year exceeded this requirement.

 

    We manage the size of our excess liquidity pool by taking into
    account the potential impact of unsecured debt maturities,
    normal business volatility, cash and collateral outflows under
    various stressed scenarios, and stressed draws for unfunded
    commitments and contractual obligations. At December 28,
    2007, our excess liquidity pool and other liquidity sources
    including maturing short-term assets and committed credit
    facilities significantly exceeded short-term obligations and
    other contractual and contingent cash outflows based on our
    estimates.

 

    At December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006,
    unencumbered liquid assets of $57 billion in the form of
    unencumbered investment grade asset-backed securities and prime
    residential mortgages were available at our regulated bank
    subsidiaries to meet potential deposit obligations, business
    activity demands and stressed liquidity needs of the bank
    subsidiaries. Our liquidity model conservatively assumes that
    these unencumbered assets are restricted from transfer and
    unavailable as a liquidity source to ML & Co. and
    other non-bank subsidiaries.





  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report


 


    page 68


 


 









Table of Contents


    At December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, our
    non-bank subsidiaries, including broker-dealer subsidiaries,
    maintained $64 billion and $58 billion, respectively,
    of unencumbered securities, including $10 billion of
    customer margin securities at December 28, 2007 and
    $12 billion at December 29, 2006. These unencumbered
    securities are an important source of liquidity for
    broker-dealer activities and other individual subsidiary
    financial commitments, and are generally restricted from
    transfer and therefore unavailable to support liquidity needs of
    ML & Co. or other subsidiaries. Proceeds from
    encumbering customer margin securities are further limited to
    supporting qualifying customer activities.

 

Off-Balance Sheet
    Financing


    We fund selected assets via derivative contracts with third
    party structures that are not consolidated on our balance sheet
    and that provide financing through both term funding
    arrangements and asset-backed commercial paper. Certain CDO and
    CLO positions are funded in these vehicles, predominantly
    pursuant to long term funding arrangements. In our liquidity
    models, we assume that under various stress scenarios, financing
    would be required from ML& Co. and its subsidiaries
    for certain of these assets. In our models, under a severe
    stress scenario, we estimate that the amount of potential future
    required funding could be up to $20 billion. Although the
    exact timing of any cash outflows is uncertain, we are confident
    that we can meet potential funding obligations without
    materially impacting the firms liquidity position based
    upon the significant excess liquidity at the holding company and
    in our banking and non-banking subsidiaries as well as our
    ability to generate cash in the public markets. Additionally,
    any purchase of these assets would not result in additional gain
    or loss to the firm as such exposure is already reflected in the
    fair value of our derivative contracts.

 

Committed Credit
    Facilities


    In addition to the Global Liquidity Sources, we maintain credit
    facilities that are available to cover regular and contingent
    funding needs. We maintain a committed, three-year
    multi-currency, unsecured bank credit facility that totaled
    $4.0 billion as of December 28, 2007 and which expires
    in April 2010. This facility permits borrowings by
    ML & Co. We borrow regularly from this facility
    as an additional funding source to conduct normal business
    activities. At December 28, 2007, we had $1.0 billion
    of borrowings outstanding under this facility. This facility
    requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth which
    we significantly exceeded. There were no borrowings outstanding
    as of December 29, 2006.

 

    We also maintain two committed, secured credit facilities which
    totaled $6.5 billion at December 28, 2007 and
    $7.5 billion at December 29, 2006. These facilities
    expire in May 2008 and December 2008. Both facilities include a
    one-year term-out feature that allows ML & Co., at its
    option, to extend borrowings under the facilities for an
    additional year beyond their respective expiration dates. The
    secured facilities permit borrowings by ML & Co. and
    select subsidiaries, secured by a broad range of collateral. At
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, we had no
    borrowings outstanding under either facility.

 

    In addition, we maintain committed, secured credit facilities
    with two financial institutions that totaled $11.75 billion
    at December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006. The
    secured facilities may be collateralized by government
    obligations eligible for pledging. The facilities expire at
    various dates through 2014, but may be terminated earlier with
    at least a nine-month notice by either party. At
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, we had no
    borrowings outstanding under these facilities.

 

Asset-Liability
    Management


    We manage the profiles of our assets and liabilities and the
    relationships between them with the objective of ensuring that
    we maintain sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations
    in all environments, including periods of financial stress. This
    asset-liability management involves maintaining the appropriate
    amount and mix of financing related to the underlying asset
    profiles and liquidity characteristics, while monitoring the
    relationship between cash flow sources and uses. Our
    asset-liability management takes into account restrictions at
    the subsidiary level with coordinated and centralized oversight
    at ML & Co. We consider a legal entity focus essential
    in view of the regulatory, tax and other considerations that can
    affect the transfer and availability of liquidity between legal
    entities. We assess the availability of cash flows to fund
    maturing liability obligations when due under stressed market
    liquidity conditions in time frames from overnight through one
    year, with an emphasis on the near term periods during which
    liquidity risk is considered to be the greatest.

 

    An important objective of our asset-liability management is
    ensuring that sufficient funding is available for our long-term
    assets and other long-term capital requirements. Long-term
    capital requirements are determined using a long-term capital
    model that takes into account:

 






     

    The portion of assets that cannot be self-funded in the secured
    financing markets, considering stressed market conditions,
    including illiquid and less liquid assets;


 

     

    Subsidiaries regulatory capital;

    Collateral on derivative contracts that may be required in the
    event of changes in our credit ratings or movements in the

     

    Portions of commitments to extend credit based on our estimate
    of the probability of draws on these commitments; and


 

     

    Other contingencies based on our estimates.



 

    In assessing the appropriateness of our long-term capital, we
    seek to: (1) ensure sufficient matching of our assets based
    on factors such as holding period, contractual maturity and
    regulatory restrictions and (2) limit the amount of
    liabilities maturing in any particular period. We also consider
    liquidity needs for business growth and circumstances that might
    cause contingent liquidity obligations. Our policy is to operate
    with an excess of long-term capital sources of at least
    $15 billion over our long-term capital requirements. At
    December 28, 2007, our long-term capital sources of
    $288.9 billion exceeded our estimated long-term capital
    requirements by more than $15 billion.

 

    Our regulated bank subsidiaries maintain strong liquidity
    positions and manage the liquidity profile of their assets,
    liabilities and commitments so that they can appropriately
    balance cash flows and meet all of their deposit and other
    funding obligations when due. This asset-liability management
    includes: projecting cash flows, monitoring balance sheet
    liquidity ratios against internal and regulatory requirements,
    monitoring depositor concentrations, and maintaining liquidity
    and contingency plans. In managing liquidity, our bank
    subsidiaries place emphasis on a stable and diversified retail
    deposit base, which serves as a reliable source of liquidity.
    The banks liquidity models use behavioral and statistical
    approaches to measure and monitor the liquidity characteristics
    of the deposits.

 

    Our asset-liability management process also focuses on
    maintaining diversification and an appropriate mix of borrowings
    through application and monitoring of internal concentration
    limits and guidelines on various factors, including debt
    instrument types, maturities, currencies, and single investors.

 

Scenario Analysis
    and Stress Testing


    Scenario analysis and stress testing is an important part of our
    liquidity management process. Our Liquidity Risk Management
    Group performs regular scenario-based stress tests covering
    credit rating downgrades and stressed market conditions both
    market-wide and in specific market segments. We run scenarios
    covering crisis durations ranging from as short as one week
    through as long as one year. Some scenarios assume that normal
    business is not interrupted.

 

    In our scenario analysis, we assume loss of access to unsecured
    funding markets during periods of financial stress. Various
    levels of severity are assessed through sensitivity analysis
    around key liquidity risk drivers and assumptions. Key
    assumptions that are stressed include diminished access to the
    secured financing markets, run-off in deposits, draws on
    liquidity facilities, cash outflows due to the loss of funding
    from off-balance sheet third party structures including
    asset-backed commercial paper conduits, derivative collateral
    outflows and changes in our credit ratings. In our modeling we
    evaluate all sources of funds that can be accessed during a
    stress event with particular focus on matching by legal entity
    locally available sources with corresponding liquidity
    requirements.

 

    Management judgment is applied in scenario modeling. The
    Liquidity Risk Management Group works with Global Risk
    Management to incorporate the results of their judgment and
    analytics where credit or market risk implications exist. We
    assess the cash flow exposures under the various scenarios and
    use the results to refine liquidity assumptions, size our excess
    liquidity pools
    and/or
    adjust the asset-liability profiles.

 

Contingency
    Funding Plan


    We maintain a contingency funding plan that outlines our
    responses to liquidity stress events of various levels of
    severity. The plan includes the funding action steps, potential
    funding strategies and a range of communication procedures that
    we will implement in the event of stressed liquidity conditions.
    We periodically review and test the contingency funding plan to
    achieve ongoing validity and readiness.

 

    Our U.S. bank subsidiaries also retain access to
    contingency funding through the Federal Reserve discount window
    and Federal Home Loan Banks, while certain
    non-U.S. subsidiaries
    have access to the central banks for the jurisdictions in which
    they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our
    liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and
    governance processes that would enable us to access these
    sources.

 










   Operational
    Risk
    




    We define operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from
    the failure of people, internal processes and systems, or from
    external events. Operational risk can arise from many sources
    including theft and fraud, improper business practices, claims
    from clients, and from events which disrupt business.

 

    The primary responsibility for managing operational risk on a
    day-to-day basis lies with our businesses and support functions.
    Each business and support group has established processes,
    systems and controls to address operational risks within their
    unit. These include the use of technology to automate processes
    and key controls; the provision and testing of business
    continuity plans to protect against major disruptions; the
    establishment of control committees to oversee the effectiveness
    of the control environment; and the training, supervision, and
    development of staff.

    In addition, we have an independent risk management function,
    Operational Risk Management (ORM), which is responsible for
    providing a framework and infrastructure to support the
    effective management and oversight of our exposure to
    operational risk. The framework includes:

 






     

 Identification, Assessment, & Monitoring of
    Risks  ORM works closely with business management
    as well as with Global Risk Management and other independent
    control functions to identify, assess, and monitor the critical
    operational risks impacting the business;


 

     

 Loss Analysis  ORM systematically captures,
    analyzes, and reports operational risk loss data based on a
    structured classification of risk. Risk categories used for
    analysis of both firm and industry loss data include business
    disruption, business practices, client selection and
    exposure, client suitability and servicing, employment
    practices, key person, technology, theft and fraud,
    transaction execution, and valuation and reporting; and


 

     

 Reporting to Governance Committees  ORM
    presents analyses of all elements of the operational risk
    framework to key governance, risk, and control committees both
    regionally and globally.



 

    When we deem prudent, we purchase insurance to protect us
    against certain operational and other risks.

 










   Other
    Risks
    




    We encounter a variety of other risks, which could have the
    ability to impact the viability, profitability, and
    cost-effectiveness of present or future transactions. Such risks
    include political, tax, and regulatory risks that may arise due
    to changes in local laws, regulations, accounting standards, or
    tax statutes. To assist in the mitigation of such risks, we
    rigorously review new and pending legislation and regulations.
    Additionally, we employ professionals in jurisdictions in which
    we operate to actively follow issues of potential concern or
    impact to Merrill Lynch and to participate in related interest
    groups.

 










   Recent
    Accounting Developments




    In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51
    (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160
    requires noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries initially to
    be measured at fair value and classified as a separate component
    of equity. Under SFAS No. 160, gains or losses on
    sales of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries are not
    recognized, instead sales of noncontrolling interests are
    accounted for as equity transactions. However, in a sale of a
    subsidiarys shares that results in the deconsolidation of
    the subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized for the difference
    between the proceeds of that sale and the carrying amount of the
    interest sold. Additionally, a new fair value basis is
    established for any remaining ownership interest.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for the first annual
    reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2008;
    earlier application is prohibited. SFAS No. 160 is
    required to be adopted prospectively, with the exception of
    certain presentation and disclosure requirements (e.g.,
    reclassifying noncontrolling interests to appear in equity),
    which are required to be adopted retrospectively. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 160 on the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141R,
    Business Combinations
    (SFAS No. 141R), which significantly
    changes the financial accounting and reporting for business
    combinations. SFAS No. 141R will require:

 






     

    More assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the
    acquisition date,


 

     

    Liabilities related to contingent consideration to be remeasured
    at fair value in each subsequent reporting period with changes
    reflected in earnings and not goodwill, and


 

     

    An acquirer in pre-acquisition periods to expense all
    acquisition-related costs.



 

    SFAS No. 141R is required to be adopted on a
    prospective basis concurrently with SFAS No. 160 and
    is effective for business combinations with an acquisition date
    in fiscal 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. We are currently
    evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 141R on the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    In December 2007, the American Securitization Forum
    (ASF) issued the Streamlined Foreclosure and
    Loss Avoidance Framework for Securitized Subprime Adjustable
    Rate Mortgage Loans (the ASF Framework). The
    ASF Framework provides guidance for servicers to streamline
    borrower evaluation procedures and to facilitate the use of
    foreclosure and loss prevention efforts (including refinancings,
    forbearances, workout plans, loan modifications,
    deeds-in-lieu
    and short sales or short payoffs). The ASF Framework attempts to
    reduce the number of U.S. subprime residential mortgage
    borrowers who might default because the borrowers cannot afford
    to pay the increased interest rate on their loans after their
    subprime residential mortgage variable loan rate resets.

 

    The ASF Framework is focused on U.S. subprime first-lien
    adjustable-rate residential mortgages that have an initial fixed
    interest rate period of 36 months or less, were originated
    between January 1, 2005 and July 31, 2007, have an
    initial interest rate reset date between January 1, 2008
    and July 31, 2010, and are included in securitized pools
    (these loans are referred to as Segment 2 subprime ARM
    loans within the ASF Framework). The ASF Framework
    requires a borrower and its U.S. subprime residential
    mortgage variable rate loan to





  
  
  
  
  




 


 


    page 71


 












Table of Contents


    meet specific conditions to qualify for a fast track loan
    modification under which the qualifying borrowers interest
    rate will be kept at the existing initial rate, generally for
    five years following the upcoming reset.

 

    In January 2008, the SECs Office of Chief Accountant (the
    OCA) issued a letter (the OCA Letter)
    addressing accounting issues that may be raised by the ASF
    Framework. The OCA Letter expressed the view that if a Segment 2
    subprime ARM loan is modified pursuant to the ASF Framework and
    that loan could legally be modified, the OCA will not object to
    the continued status of the transferee as a QSPE under SFAS
    No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
    Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities (a
    replacement of FASB Statement No. 125) (SFAS
    No. 140). The OCA requested the FASB to immediately
    address the issues that have arisen in the application of the
    QSPE guidance in SFAS No. 140.

 

    Merrill Lynch may make loan modifications in accordance with the
    ASF Framework in 2008 but does not expect them to have a
    material effect on our accounting for U.S. sub-prime
    residential mortgage loans or securitizations or retained
    interests in securitizations of U.S. sub-prime residential
    mortgage loans.

 

    In June 2007, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of
    the AICPA issued Statement of Position
    07-1,
Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide
    Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and
    Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies
    (SOP 07-1).
    The intent of
    SOP 07-1
    is to clarify which entities are within the scope of the AICPA
    Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies (the
    Guide). For those entities that are investment
    companies under
    SOP 07-1,
    the SOP also addresses whether the specialized industry
    accounting principles of the Guide (referred to as
    investment company accounting) should be retained by
    the parent company in consolidation or by an investor that
    accounts for the investment under the equity method because it
    has significant influence over the investee. On October 17,
    2007, the FASB proposed an indefinite delay of the effective
    dates of
    SOP 07-1
    to allow the Board to address certain implementation issues that
    have arisen and possibly revise
    SOP 07-1.

 

    In April 2007, the FASB issued FSP
    No. FIN 39-1,
Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39 (FSP
    FIN 39-1).
    FSP
    FIN 39-1
    modifies FIN No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related
    to Certain Contracts, and permits companies to offset cash
    collateral receivables or payables with net derivative
    positions. FSP
    FIN 39-1
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007 with early adoption permitted. FSP
    FIN 39-1
    will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements as it clarified the acceptability of existing market
    practice, which we apply, for netting of cash collateral against
    net derivative assets and liabilities.

 

    In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, which
    provides a fair value option election that allows companies to
    irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent
    measurement attribute for certain financial assets and
    liabilities. Changes in fair value for assets and liabilities
    for which the election is made will be recognized in earnings as
    they occur. SFAS No. 159 permits the fair value option
    election on an
    instrument-by-instrument
    basis at initial recognition of an asset or liability or upon an
    event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that
    instrument. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the
    beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins
    after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of
    the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before
    November 15, 2007 provided that the entity makes that
    choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year, has not
    yet issued financial statements for any interim period of the
    fiscal year of adoption, and also elects to apply the provisions
    of SFAS No. 157 (described below). We early adopted
    SFAS No. 159 in the first quarter of 2007. In
    connection with this adoption, management reviewed its treasury
    liquidity portfolio and determined that we should decrease our
    economic exposure to interest rate risk by eliminating long-term
    fixed rate assets from the portfolio and replacing them with
    floating rate assets. The fixed rate assets had been classified
    as available-for-sale and the unrealized losses related to such
    assets had been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
    loss. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 159, the loss
    related to these assets was removed from accumulated other
    comprehensive loss and a loss of approximately
    $185 million, net of tax, primarily related to these
    assets, was recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to
    beginning retained earnings, with no material impact to total
    stockholders equity. Refer to Note 3 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 

    In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value
    hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair
    value and enhances disclosure about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 nullifies the guidance provided by
    EITF 02-3
    that prohibits recognition of day one gains or losses on
    derivative transactions where model inputs that significantly
    impact valuation are not observable. In addition,
    SFAS No. 157 prohibits the use of block discounts for
    large positions of unrestricted financial instruments that trade
    in an active market and requires an issuer to incorporate
    changes in its own credit spreads when determining the fair
    value of its liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 with
    early adoption permitted provided that the entity has not yet
    issued financial statements for that fiscal year, including any
    interim periods. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are to
    be applied prospectively, except that the provisions related to
    block discounts and existing derivative financial instruments
    measured under
    EITF 02-3
    are to be applied as a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to
    opening retained earnings in the year of adoption. We early
    adopted SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of 2007. The
    cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings was
    an increase of approximately $53 million, net of tax,
    primarily representing the difference between the carrying
    amounts and fair value of derivative contracts valued using the
    guidance in





  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report

EITF 02-3.
    The impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 was not material
    to our Consolidated Statement of Earnings. Refer to Note 3
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    information.

 

    In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R
    (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158
    requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded
    status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan
    assets and the benefit obligation as an asset or liability in
    its statement of financial condition. Upon adoption,
    SFAS No. 158 requires an entity to recognize
    previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior
    service costs within accumulated other comprehensive loss, net
    of tax. In accordance with the guidance in
    SFAS No. 158, we adopted this provision of the
    standard for year-end 2006. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 158 resulted in a net credit of
    $65 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss
    recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements at
    December 29, 2006. SFAS No. 158 also requires
    defined benefit plan assets and benefit obligations to be
    measured as of the date of the companys fiscal year-end.
    We have historically used a September 30 measurement date. Under
    the provisions of SFAS No. 158, we will be required to
    change our measurement date to coincide with our fiscal
    year-end. This provision of SFAS No. 158 will be
    effective for us in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the
    impact of adoption of this provision of SFAS No. 158
    on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48).
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
    Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted FIN 48 in
    the first quarter of 2007. The impact of the adoption of
    FIN 48 resulted in a decrease to beginning retained
    earnings and an increase to the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits of approximately $66 million. See Note 14 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 

    In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting
    for Servicing of Financial Assets
    (SFAS No. 156). SFAS No. 156
    amends SFAS No. 140 to require all separately recognized
    servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially
    measured at fair value, if practicable. SFAS No. 156
    also permits servicers to subsequently measure each separate
    class of servicing assets and liabilities at fair value rather
    than at the lower of amortized cost or market. For those
    companies that elect to measure their servicing assets and
    liabilities at fair value, SFAS No. 156 requires the
    difference between the carrying value and fair value at the date
    of adoption to be recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment
    to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in
    which the election is made. Prior to adoption of
    SFAS No. 156, we accounted for servicing assets and
    servicing liabilities at the lower of amortized cost or market.
    We adopted SFAS No. 156 on December 30, 2006. We
    have not elected to subsequently fair value those mortgage
    servicing rights (MSR) held as of the date of
    adoption or those MSRs acquired or retained after
    December 30, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 156
    did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

 

    In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140
    (SFAS No. 155). SFAS No. 155
    clarifies the bifurcation requirements for certain financial
    instruments and permits hybrid financial instruments that
    contain a bifurcatable embedded derivative to be accounted for
    as a single financial instrument at fair value with changes in
    fair value recognized in earnings. This election is permitted on
    an
    instrument-by-instrument
    basis for all hybrid financial instruments held, obtained, or
    issued as of the adoption date. At adoption, any difference
    between the total carrying amount of the individual components
    of the existing bifurcated hybrid financial instruments and the
    fair value of the combined hybrid financial instruments is
    recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning
    retained earnings. We adopted SFAS No. 155 on a
    prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Since
    SFAS No. 159 incorporates accounting and disclosure
    requirements that are similar to SFAS No. 155, we
    apply SFAS No. 159, rather than
    SFAS No. 155, to our fair value elections for hybrid
    financial instruments.

 

    We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004),
    Share-Based Payment, a revision of
    SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation (SFAS No. 123R) as of the
    beginning of the first quarter of 2006. Under
    SFAS No. 123R, compensation expenses for share-based
    awards that do not require future service are recorded
    immediately, and share-based awards that require future service
    continue to be amortized into expense over the relevant service
    period. We adopted SFAS No. 123R under the modified
    prospective method whereby the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R are generally applied only to
    share-based awards granted or modified subsequent to adoption.
    Thus, for Merrill Lynch, SFAS No. 123R required the
    immediate expensing of share-based awards granted or modified in
    2006 to retirement-eligible employees, including awards that are
    subject to non-compete provisions.

 

    Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we had
    recognized expense for share-based compensation over the vesting
    period stipulated in the grant for all employees. This included
    those who had satisfied retirement eligibility criteria but were
    subject to a non-compete agreement that applied from the date of
    retirement through each applicable vesting period. Previously,
    we had accelerated any unrecognized compensation cost for such
    awards if a retirement-eligible employee left Merrill Lynch.
    However, because SFAS No. 123R





  
  
  
  
  




 


 


    page 73


 












Table of Contents


    applies only to awards granted or modified in 2006, expenses for
    share-based awards granted prior to 2006 to employees who were
    retirement-eligible with respect to those awards must continue
    to be amortized over the stated vesting period.

 

    In addition, beginning with performance year 2006, for which we
    granted stock awards in January 2007, we accrued the expense for
    future awards granted to retirement-eligible employees over the
    award performance year instead of recognizing the entire expense
    related to the award on the grant date. Compensation expense for
    2006 performance year and all future stock awards granted to
    employees not eligible for retirement with respect to those
    awards will be recognized over the applicable vesting period.

 

    SFAS No. 123R also requires expected forfeitures of
    share-based compensation awards for non-retirement-eligible
    employees to be included in determining compensation expense.
    Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, any benefits
    of employee forfeitures of such awards were recorded as a
    reduction of compensation expense when the employee left Merrill
    Lynch and forfeited the award. In the first quarter of 2006, we
    recorded a benefit based on expected forfeitures which was not
    material to the results of operations for the quarter.

 

    The adoption of SFAS No. 123R resulted in a charge to
    compensation expense of approximately $550 million on a
    pre-tax basis and $370 million on an after-tax basis in the
    first quarter of 2006.

 

    The adoption of SFAS No. 123R, combined with other
    business and competitive considerations, prompted us to
    undertake a comprehensive review of our stock-based incentive
    compensation awards, including vesting schedules and retirement
    eligibility requirements, examining their impact to both Merrill
    Lynch and its employees. Upon the completion of this review, the
    Management Development and Compensation Committee of Merrill
    Lynchs Board of Directors determined that to fulfill the
    objective of retaining high quality personnel, future stock
    grants should contain more stringent retirement provisions.
    These provisions include a combination of increased age and
    length of service requirements. While the stock awards of
    employees who retire continue to vest, retired employees are
    subject to continued compliance with the strict non-compete
    provisions of those awards. To facilitate transition to the more
    stringent future requirements, the terms of most outstanding
    stock awards previously granted to employees, including certain
    executive officers, were modified, effective March 31,
    2006, to permit employees to be immediately eligible for
    retirement with respect to those earlier awards. While we
    modified the retirement-related provisions of the previous stock
    awards, the vesting and non-compete provisions for those awards
    remain in force.

 

    Since the provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to awards
    modified in 2006, these modifications required us to record
    additional one-time compensation expense in the first quarter of
    2006 for the remaining unamortized amount of all awards to
    employees who had not previously been retirement-eligible under
    the original provisions of those awards.

 

    The one-time, non-cash charge associated with the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, and the policy modifications to
    previous awards resulted in a net charge to compensation expense
    in the first quarter of 2006 of approximately $1.8 billion
    pre-tax, and $1.2 billion after-tax, or a net impact of
    $1.34 and $1.21 on basic and diluted earnings per share,
    respectively. Policy modifications to previously granted awards
    amounted to $1.2 billion of the pre-tax charge and impacted
    approximately 6,300 employees.

 

    Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we presented
    the cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of the
    compensation expense recognized on share-based compensation as
    operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires cash flows resulting
    from tax deductions in excess of the grant-date fair value of
    share-based awards to be included in cash flows from financing
    activities. The excess tax benefits of $283 million related
    to total share-based compensation included in cash flows from
    financing activities in the first quarter of 2006 would have
    been included in cash flows from operating activities if we had
    not adopted SFAS No. 123R.

 

    As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R, approximately
    $600 million of liabilities associated with the Financial
    Advisor Capital Accumulation Award Plan (FACAAP)
    were reclassified to stockholders equity. In addition, as
    a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R, the unamortized
    portion of employee stock grants, which was previously reported
    as a separate component of stockholders equity on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets, has been reclassified to paid-in
    capital.

 

    In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the
    Emerging Issues Task Force on Issue
    04-5,
Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights
    (EITF 04-5).
EITF 04-5
    presumes that a general partner controls a limited partnership,
    and should therefore consolidate a limited partnership, unless
    the limited partners have the substantive ability to remove the
    general partner without cause based on a simple majority vote or
    can otherwise dissolve the limited partnership, or unless the
    limited partners have substantive participating rights over
    decision making. The guidance in
    EITF 04-5
    was effective beginning in the third quarter of 2005 for all new
    limited partnership agreements and any limited partnership
    agreements that were modified. For those partnership agreements
    that existed at the date
    EITF 04-5
    was issued, the guidance became effective in the first quarter
    of 2006. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
    impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Managements Discussion of
    Financial Responsibility, Disclosure Controls and
    Procedures, and Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting




 










   Financial
    Responsibility




    Oversight is provided by independent units within Merrill Lynch,
    working together to maintain Merrill Lynchs internal
    control standards. Corporate Audit reports directly to the Audit
    Committee of the Board of Directors, providing independent
    appraisals of Merrill Lynchs internal controls and
    compliance with established policies and procedures. Finance
    management establishes accounting policies and procedures,
    measures and monitors financial risk, and independently from the
    businesses prepares financial statements that fairly present the
    underlying transactions and events of Merrill Lynch. Independent
    risk groups monitor capital adequacy and liquidity management
    and have oversight responsibility for Merrill Lynchs
    market and credit risks independent from business line
    management. These groups have clear authority to enforce trading
    and credit limits using various systems and procedures to
    monitor positions and risks. The Office of the General Counsel
    serves in a counseling and advisory role to management and the
    business groups. In this role, the Office of the General Counsel
    develops policies; works with the business in monitoring
    compliance with internal policies, external rules, and industry
    regulations; and provides legal advice, representation,
    execution, and transaction support to the businesses.

 

    ML & Co. has established a Disclosure Committee to
    assist the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
    in fulfilling their responsibilities for overseeing the accuracy
    and timeliness of disclosures made by ML & Co. The
    Disclosure Committee is made up of senior representatives of
    Merrill Lynchs Finance, Investor Relations, Office of the
    General Counsel, Treasury, Tax and independent risk groups, and
    is responsible for implementing and evaluating disclosure
    controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. The Disclosure
    Committee meets at least eight times a year. Meetings are held
    as needed to review key events and disclosures impacting the
    period throughout each fiscal quarter and prior to the filing of
    ML & Co.s
    Form 10-K
    and 10-Q
    reports and proxy statement with the SEC.

 

    The Board of Directors designated Merrill Lynchs
    Guidelines for Business Conduct as the companys code of
    ethics for directors, officers and employees in performing their
    duties. The Guidelines set forth written standards for employee
    conduct with respect to conflicts of interest, disclosure
    obligations, compliance with applicable laws and rules and other
    matters. The Guidelines also set forth information and
    procedures for employees to report ethical or accounting
    concerns, misconduct or violations of the Guidelines in a
    confidential manner. The Board of Directors adopted Merrill
    Lynchs Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals in 2003.
    The Code, which applies to all Merrill Lynch professionals who
    participate in our public disclosure process, supplements our
    Guidelines for Business Conduct and is designed to promote
    honest and ethical conduct, full, fair and accurate disclosure
    and compliance with applicable laws.

 

    The independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, performs annual audits of
    Merrill Lynchs financial statements in accordance with the
    Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
    (United States). They openly discuss with the Audit Committee
    their views on the quality of the financial statements and
    related disclosures and the adequacy of Merrill Lynchs
    internal accounting controls. Quarterly review reports on the
    unaudited interim financial statements are also issued by
    Deloitte & Touche LLP. The Audit Committee appoints
    the independent registered public accounting firm. The
    independent registered public accounting firm is given
    unrestricted access to all financial records and related data,
    including minutes of meetings of stockholders, the Board of
    Directors, and committees of the Board.

 

    As part of their oversight role, committees of the Board
    supervise management in the formulation of corporate policies,
    procedures and controls. The Audit Committee, which consists of
    four independent directors, oversees the internal audit function
    and considers the adequacy of our internal controls. In
    addition, the Audit Committee reviews the framework established
    by management to assess and manage the major categories of risk
    affecting Merrill Lynch; the policies and procedures for
    managing operational, legal and reputational risk; and oversees
    the compliance function. It also reviews the annual Consolidated
    Financial Statements and other material financial information
    with management and Merrill Lynchs independent registered
    public accounting firm, and evaluates the performance,
    independence and fees of our independent registered public
    accounting firm and the professional services it provides. The
    Audit Committee also has the authority to appoint or replace the
    independent registered public accounting firm and monitors the
    treatment of concerns relating to accounting, internal
    accounting controls and auditing matters reported by employees,
    shareholders and other interested parties.

 

    The Finance Committee, which consists of four independent
    directors, reviews, recommends, and approves policies regarding
    financial commitments and investments. It also reviews and
    approves certain financial commitments, acquisitions,
    divestitures, and proprietary investments. In addition, the
    Finance Committee oversees balance sheet and capital management,
    corporate funding policies and financing plans. It also reviews
    Merrill Lynchs policies and procedures for managing
    exposure to market and credit risks, and when appropriate,
    reviews significant risk exposures and trends in these
    categories of risk.

   Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures




    During the 2007 year-end financial close process,
    management implemented additional reviews and analyses of
    certain financial data presented in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements, including an enhanced review of the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows. As a result of the enhanced reviews,
    the Company discovered an error, due to an adjustment that
    incorrectly reflected cash flows received from certain customer
    transactions, affecting its Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows for 2005 and 2006. The adjustment resulted in an
    overstatement of cash flows received from derivatives financing
    transactions (financing activities) and was offset by a
    corresponding overstatement in cash flows used for trading
    liabilities (operating activities). Management determined that
    its 2005 and 2006 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows should
    be restated and has done so in its 2007 Annual Report.

 

    ML & Co.s Disclosure Committee assists with
    implementing, monitoring and evaluating our disclosure controls
    and procedures. ML & Co.s Chief Executive
    Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Disclosure Committee have
    evaluated the effectiveness of ML & Co.s
    disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
    Rule 13a-15(e)
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of
    the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation,
    ML & Co.s Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer have concluded that ML & Co.s
    disclosure controls and procedures are effective.

 

    No other change in ML & Co.s internal control
    over financial reporting (as defined in
    Rule 13a-15(f)
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during
    the fourth fiscal quarter of 2007 that has materially affected,
    or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
    ML & Co.s internal control over financial
    reporting.

 










   Report
    on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




    Management recognizes its responsibility for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting
    and has designed internal controls and procedures to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial
    statements and related notes in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.
    Management assessed the effectiveness of Merrill Lynchs
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 28, 2007. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment,
    management believes that Merrill Lynch maintained effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 28, 2007.

 

    Deloitte & Touche LLP, Merrill Lynchs
    independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an
    opinion on the effectiveness of Merrill Lynchs internal
    control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2007,
    based on the criteria established in Internal
    Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This report

Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm


 










   To
    the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Merrill
    Lynch & Co., Inc.:




    We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and subsidiaries
    (Merrill Lynch) as of December 28, 2007, based
    on criteria established in Internal Control 
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Merrill Lynchs
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on Merrill Lynchs internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

 

    We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

 

    A companys internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    companys principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the companys board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A companys
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    companys assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

 

    Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

 

    In our opinion, Merrill Lynch maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 28, 2007, based on the criteria established in
    Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

 

    We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 28, 2007 of Merrill Lynch and our report dated
    February 25, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    financial statements, included an explanatory paragraph
    regarding the changes in accounting methods in 2007 relating to
    the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 157, Fair Value Measurement,
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159,
    The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
    Financial Liabilities  Including an amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 115, and FASB Interpretation
    No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income
    Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,
    and in 2006 for share-based payments to conform to Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004),
    Share-Based Payment and included an
    explanatory paragraph relating to the restatement discussed in
    Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.

Report of Independent
    Registered Public Accounting Firm




 










   To
    the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Merrill
    Lynch & Co., Inc.:




    We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. and subsidiaries
    (Merrill Lynch) as of December 28, 2007 and
    December 29, 2006, and the related consolidated statements
    of (loss)/earnings, changes in stockholders equity,
    comprehensive (loss)/income and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 28, 2007. These
    financial statements are the responsibility of Merrill
    Lynchs management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

 

    We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

 

    In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
    Merrill Lynch as of December 28, 2007 and December 29,
    2006, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 28,
    2007, in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America.

 

    As discussed in Notes 1, 3, 13 and 14 to the consolidated
    financial statements, in 2007 Merrill Lynch adopted Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value
    Measurement, Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for
    Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  Including
    an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115, and FASB
    Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty
    in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement
    No. 109, and in 2006 Merrill Lynch changed its
    method of accounting for share-based payments to conform to
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment.

 

    As discussed in Note 20, the 2006 and 2005 consolidated
    financial statements have been restated.

 

    We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Merrill Lynchs internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 28, 2007, based on the criteria established
    in Internal Control  Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2008
    expressed an unqualified opinion on Merrill Lynchs
    internal control over financial reporting.

   Basis
    of Presentation
    




    The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    ML & Co. and subsidiaries (collectively, Merrill
    Lynch). The Consolidated Financial Statements are
    presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted
    Accounting Principles, which include industry practices.
    Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.
    Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period
    financial statements to conform to the current period
    presentation.

 

    The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in
    U.S. dollars. Many
    non-U.S. subsidiaries
    have a functional currency (i.e., the currency in which
    activities are primarily conducted) that is other than the
    U.S. dollar, often the currency of the country in which a
    subsidiary is domiciled. Subsidiaries assets and
    liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at year-end
    exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at
    average exchange rates during the year. Adjustments that result
    from translating amounts in a subsidiarys functional
    currency and related hedging, net of related tax effects, are
    reported in stockholders equity as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive loss. All other translation
    adjustments are included in earnings. Merrill Lynch uses
    derivatives to manage the currency exposure arising from
    activities in
    non-U.S. subsidiaries.
    See the Derivatives section for additional information on
    accounting for derivatives.

 

    During the fourth quarter of 2007, Merrill Lynch began reporting
    revenues and expenses from special purpose entity
    (SPE) investments that are consolidated under
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
    No. 94, Consolidation of All Majority-Owned

    Interest Entities  an interpretation of ARB
    No. 51 (FIN 46R), in their respective
    line items in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, whereas
    in prior periods, these amounts were reported separately as
    revenues from consolidated investments and expenses of
    consolidated investments. The majority of the revenues and
    expenses that were reclassified are now reported in interest and
    other revenues and other expenses. All prior period amounts have
    been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

 

    Merrill Lynch offers a broad array of products and services to
    its diverse client base of individuals, small to mid-size
    businesses, employee benefit plans, corporations, financial
    institutions, and governments around the world. These products
    and services are offered from a number of locations globally. In
    some cases, the same or similar products and services may be
    offered to both individual and institutional clients, utilizing
    the same infrastructure. In other cases, a single infrastructure
    may be used to support multiple products and services offered to
    clients. When Merrill Lynch analyzes its profitability, it does
    not focus on the profitability of a single product or service.
    Instead, Merrill Lynch looks at the profitability of businesses
    offering an array of products and services to various types of
    clients. The profitability of the products and services offered
    to individuals, small to mid-size businesses, and employee
    benefit plans is analyzed separately from the profitability of
    products and services offered to corporations, financial
    institutions, and governments, regardless of whether there is
    commonality in products and services infrastructure. As such,
    Merrill Lynch does not separately disclose the costs associated
    with the products and services sold or general and
    administrative costs either in total or by product.

 

    When determining the prices for products and services, Merrill
    Lynch considers multiple factors, including prices being offered
    in the market for similar products and services, the
    competitiveness of its pricing compared to competitors, the
    profitability of its businesses and its overall profitability,
    as well as the profitability, creditworthiness, and importance
    of the overall client relationships.

 

    Shared expenses that are incurred to support products and
    services and infrastructures are allocated to the businesses
    based on various methodologies, which may include headcount,
    square footage, and certain other criteria. Similarly, certain
    revenues may be shared based upon agreed methodologies. When
    looking at the profitability of various businesses, Merrill
    Lynch considers all expenses incurred, including overhead and
    the costs of shared services, as all are considered integral to
    the operation of the businesses.

 










   Discontinued
    Operations
    




    On August 13, 2007, we announced that we will form a
    strategic business relationship with AEGON, N.V.
    (AEGON) in the areas of insurance and investment
    products. As part of this relationship, we had agreed to sell
    Merrill Lynch Life Insurance Company and ML Life Insurance
    Company of New York (together Merrill Lynch Insurance
    Group or MLIG) to AEGON for $1.3 billion.
    We will continue to serve the insurance needs of our clients
    through our core distribution and advisory capabilities. The
    sale of MLIG was completed in the fourth quarter of 2007 and
    resulted in an after-tax gain of approximately
    $316 million. The gain along with the financial results of
    MLIG, have been reported within discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. We previously reported the results of MLIG in
    the Global Wealth Management (GWM) business segment.
    Refer to Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for additional information.

 

    On December 24, 2007 we announced that we had reached an
    agreement with GE Capital to sell Merrill Lynch Capital, a
    wholly-owned middle-market commercial finance business. The sale
    includes substantially all of Merrill Lynch Capitals
    operations, including its commercial real estate division. This
    transaction closed on February 4, 2008. We have included
    results of Merrill Lynch Capital within discontinued operations
    for all periods presented. We previously reported results of
    Merrill Lynch Capital in the Global Markets and Investment
    Banking (GMI) business segment. Refer to
    Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

 










   Consolidation
    Accounting Policies
    




    The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of
    Merrill Lynch, whose subsidiaries are generally controlled
    through a majority voting interest. In certain cases, Merrill
    Lynch subsidiaries may also be consolidated based on a risks and
    rewards approach. Merrill Lynch does not consolidate those
    special purpose entities that meet the criteria of a qualified
    special purpose entity (QSPE).

 

    Merrill Lynch determines whether it is required to consolidate
    an entity by first evaluating whether the entity qualifies as a
    voting rights entity (VRE), a variable interest
    entity (VIE), or a QSPE.

 

    VREs  In accordance with the guidance in
    FIN 46R, VREs are defined to include entities that have
    both equity at risk that is sufficient to fund future operations
    and have equity investors with decision making ability that
    absorb the majority of the expected losses and expected returns
    of the entity. In accordance with SFAS No. 94, Merrill
    Lynch generally consolidates those VREs where it holds a
    controlling financial interest. For investments in limited
    partnerships and certain limited liability corporations that
    Merrill Lynch does not control, Merrill Lynch applies Emerging
    Issues Task Force (EITF) Topic D-46, Accounting
    for Limited Partnership Investments, which requires use of
    the equity method of accounting for investors that have more
    than a minor influence, which is typically defined as an
    investment of greater than 3% of the outstanding equity in the
    entity. For more traditional corporate structures, in accordance
    with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The
    Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock,
    Merrill Lynch applies the equity method of accounting where
    it has significant influence over the investee. Significant
    influence can be evidenced by a significant





  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report


 


    page 88


 


 









Table of Contents


    ownership interest (which is generally defined as a voting
    interest of 20% to 50%), significant board of director
    representation, or other contracts and arrangements.

 

    VIEs  Those entities that do not meet the VRE
    criteria as defined in FIN 46R are generally analyzed for
    consolidation as either VIEs or QSPEs. Merrill Lynch
    consolidates those VIEs in which it absorbs the majority of the
    variability in expected losses
    and/or the
    variability in expected returns of the entity as required by
    FIN 46R. Merrill Lynch relies on a qualitative
    and/or
    quantitative analysis, including an analysis of the design of
    the entity, to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of the
    VIE and therefore must consolidate the VIE. Merrill Lynch
    reassesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE upon
    the occurrence of a reconsideration event.

 

    QSPEs  QSPEs are passive entities with significantly
    limited permitted activities. QSPEs are generally used as
    securitization vehicles and are limited in the type of assets
    they may hold, the derivatives that they can enter into and the
    level of discretion they may exercise through servicing
    activities. In accordance with SFAS No. 140,
    Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishment of Liabilities
    (SFAS No. 140), and FIN 46R,
    Merrill Lynch does not consolidate QSPEs.

 










   Securitization
    Activities
    




    In the normal course of business, Merrill Lynch securitizes:
    commercial and residential mortgage loans and home equity loans;
    municipal, government, and corporate bonds; and other types of
    financial assets. Merrill Lynch may retain interests in the
    securitized financial assets through holding tranches of the
    securitization. In accordance with SFAS No. 140,
    Merrill Lynch recognizes transfers of financial assets that
    relinquish control as sales to the extent of cash and any
    proceeds received. Control is considered to be relinquished when
    all of the following conditions have been met:

 







 
     


    The transferred assets have been legally isolated from the
    transferor even in bankruptcy or other receivership;


 

 
     


    The transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it
    received, or if the entity is a QSPE the beneficial interest
    holders have that right; and


 

 
     


    The transferor does not maintain effective control over the
    transferred assets (e.g. the ability to unilaterally cause the
    holder to return specific transferred assets).



 










   Revenue
    Recognition
    




    Principal transactions revenues include both realized and
    unrealized gains and losses on trading assets and trading
    liabilities and investment securities classified as trading
    investments. These instruments are recorded at fair value. Fair
    value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or
    paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
    marketplace participants. Gains and losses are recognized on a
    trade date basis.

 

    Commissions revenues includes commissions, mutual fund
    distribution fees and contingent deferred sales charge revenue,
    which are all accrued as earned. Commissions revenues also
    includes mutual fund redemption fees, which are recognized at
    the time of redemption. Commissions revenues earned from certain
    customer equity transactions are recorded net of related
    brokerage, clearing and exchange fees.

 

    Investment banking revenues include underwriting revenues and
    fees for merger and acquisition advisory services, which are
    accrued when services for the transactions are substantially
    completed. Underwriting revenues are presented net of
    transaction-related expenses. Transaction-related expenses,
    primarily legal, travel and other costs directly associated with
    the transaction, are deferred and recognized in the same period
    as the related revenue from the investment banking transaction
    to match revenue recognition.

 

    Managed accounts and other fee-based revenues primarily consist
    of asset-priced portfolio service fees earned from the
    administration of separately managed accounts and other
    investment accounts for retail investors, annual account fees,
    and certain other account-related fees. In addition, until the
    merger of our Merrill Lynch Investment Management
    (MLIM) business with BlackRock, Inc.
    (BlackRock) at the end of the third quarter of 2006
    (BlackRock merger), managed accounts and other
    fee-based revenues also included fees earned from the management
    and administration of retail mutual funds and institutional
    funds such as pension assets, and performance fees earned on
    certain separately managed accounts and institutional money
    management arrangements. For additional information regarding
    the BlackRock merger, refer to Note 18 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

 

    Earnings from equity method investments includes Merrill
    Lynchs pro rata share of income and losses associated with
    investments accounted for under the equity method.

 

    Other revenues include gains/(losses) on investment securities,
    including unrealized losses on certain available-for-sale
    securities, gains/(losses) on private equity investments that
    are held for capital appreciation
    and/or
    current income, and gains/(losses) on loans and other
    miscellaneous items.

 

    Contractual interest and dividends received and paid on trading
    assets and trading liabilities, excluding derivatives, are
    recognized on an accrual basis as a component of interest and
    dividend revenues and interest expense. Interest and dividends
    on investment securities are





  
  
  
  
  




 


 


    page 89


 












Table of Contents


    recognized on an accrual basis as a component of interest and
    dividend revenues. Interest related to loans, notes, and
    mortgages, securities financing activities and certain short-
    and long-term borrowings are recorded on an accrual basis with
    related interest recorded as interest revenue or interest
    expense, as applicable. Contractual interest expense on
    structured notes is recorded as a component of interest expense.

 










   Use
    of Estimates
    




    In presenting the Consolidated Financial Statements, management
    makes estimates regarding:

 






     

    Valuations of assets and liabilities requiring fair value
    estimates;


 

     

    The outcome of litigation;


 

     

    The realization of deferred taxes and the recognition and
    measurement of uncertain tax positions;


 

     

    Assumptions and cash flow projections used in determining
    whether VIEs should be consolidated and the determination of the
    qualified status of QSPEs;


 

     

    The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets;


 

     

    The amortization period of intangible assets with definite lives;


 

     

    Valuation of share-based payment compensation arrangements; and


 

     

    Other matters that affect the reported amounts and disclosure of
    contingencies in the financial statements.



 

    Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgment and available
    information. Therefore, actual results could differ from those
    estimates and could have a material impact on the Consolidated
    Financial Statements, and it is possible that such changes could
    occur in the near term. A discussion of certain areas in which
    estimates are a significant component of the amounts reported in
    the Consolidated Financial Statements follows:

 










   Fair
    Value Measurement
    




    Merrill Lynch accounts for a significant portion of its
    financial instruments at fair value or considers fair value in
    their measurement. Merrill Lynch accounts for certain financial
    assets and liabilities at fair value under various accounting
    literature, including SFAS No. 115, Accounting for
    Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities
    (SFAS No. 115),
    SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments
    and Hedging Activities (SFAS No. 133),
    and SFAS No. 159, Fair Value Option for Certain
    Financial Assets and Liabilities
    (SFAS No. 159). Merrill Lynch also
    accounts for certain assets at fair value under applicable
    industry guidance, namely broker-dealer and investment company
    accounting guidance.

 

    Merrill Lynch early adopted the provisions of
    SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements
    (SFAS No. 157), in the first quarter
    of 2007. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes
    a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value
    hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair
    value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value
    measurements. SFAS No. 157 nullifies the guidance
    provided by EITF Issue
    No. 02-3,
Issues Involved in Accounting for Derivative Contracts Held
    for Trading Purposes and Contracts Involved in Energy Trading
    and Risk Management Activities
    (EITF 02-3),
    which prohibited recognition of day one gains or losses on
    derivative transactions where model inputs that significantly
    impact valuation are not observable.

 

    Fair values for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative
    financial instruments, principally forwards, options, and swaps,
    represent the present value of amounts estimated to be received
    from or paid to a marketplace participant in settlement of these
    instruments (i.e., the amount Merrill Lynch would expect to
    receive in a derivative asset assignment or would expect to pay
    to have a derivative liability assumed). These derivatives are
    valued using pricing models based on the net present value of
    estimated future cash flows and directly observed prices from
    exchange-traded derivatives, other OTC trades, or external
    pricing services, while taking into account the
    counterpartys creditworthiness, or Merrill Lynchs
    own creditworthiness, as appropriate. Determining the fair value
    for OTC derivative contracts can require a significant level of
    estimation and management judgment.

 

    New and/or
    complex instruments may have immature or limited markets. As a
    result, the pricing models used for valuation often incorporate
    significant estimates and assumptions that market participants
    would use in pricing the instrument, which may impact the
    results of operations reported in the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. For instance, on long-dated and illiquid contracts
    extrapolation methods are applied to observed market data in
    order to estimate inputs and assumptions that are not directly
    observable. This enables Merrill Lynch to mark to fair value all
    positions consistently when only a subset of prices are directly
    observable. Values for OTC derivatives are verified using
    observed information about the costs of hedging the risk and
    other trades in the market. As the markets for these products
    develop, Merrill Lynch continually refines its pricing models to
    correlate more closely to the market price of these instruments.

 

    Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 157, Merrill Lynch
    followed the provisions of
    EITF 02-3.
    Under
    EITF 02-3,
    recognition of day one gains and losses on derivative
    transactions where model inputs that significantly impact
    valuation are not observable were prohibited. Day one gains and
    losses deferred at inception under
    EITF 02-3
    were recognized at the earlier of when the valuation of such
    derivative became





  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report


 


    page 90


 


 









Table of Contents


observable or at the termination of
    the contract. SFAS No. 157 nullifies this guidance in
    EITF 02-3.
    Although this guidance in
    EITF 02-3
    has been nullified, the recognition of significant inception
    gains and losses that incorporate unobservable inputs are
    reviewed by management to ensure such gains and losses are
    derived from observable inputs
    and/or
    incorporate reasonable assumptions about the unobservable
    component, such as implied bid-offer adjustments.
    

 

    Certain financial instruments recorded at fair value are
    initially measured using mid-market prices which results in
    gross long and short positions marked-to-market at the same
    pricing level prior to the application of position netting. The
    resulting net positions are then adjusted to fair value
    representing the exit price as defined in
    SFAS No. 157. The significant adjustments include
    liquidity and counterparty credit risk.

 

Liquidity


    Merrill Lynch makes adjustments to bring a position from a
    mid-market to a bid or offer price, depending upon the net open
    position. Merrill Lynch values net long positions at bid prices
    and net short positions at offer prices. These adjustments are
    based upon either observable or implied bid-offer prices.

 

Counterparty
    Credit Risk


    In determining fair value Merrill Lynch considers both the
    credit risk of its counterparties, as well its own
    creditworthiness. Credit risk to third parties is generally
    mitigated by entering into netting and collateral arrangements.
    Net exposure is then measured with consideration of a
    counterpartys creditworthiness and is incorporated into
    the fair value of the respective instruments. The calculation of
    the credit adjustment for derivatives is generally based upon
    observable market credit spreads.

 

    SFAS No. 157 requires that Merrill Lynchs own
    creditworthiness be considered when determining the fair value
    of an instrument. The approach to measuring the impact of
    Merrill Lynchs own credit on an instrument is the same
    approach as that used to measure third party credit risk.

 

    See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information.

 










   Legal
    Reserves
    




    Merrill Lynch is a party in various actions, some of which
    involve claims for substantial amounts. Amounts are accrued for
    the financial resolution of claims that have either been
    asserted or are deemed probable of assertion if, in the opinion
    of management, it is both probable that a liability has been
    incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated. In many cases, it is not possible to determine
    whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the
    ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until years after
    the litigation has been commenced, in which case no accrual is
    made until that time. Accruals are subject to significant
    estimation by management with input from outside counsel.

 










   Income
    Taxes
    




    Merrill Lynch provides for income taxes on all transactions that
    have been recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements in
    accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income
    Taxes (SFAS No. 109). Accordingly,
    deferred taxes are adjusted to reflect the tax rates at which
    future taxable amounts will likely be settled or realized. The
    effects of tax rate changes on future deferred tax liabilities
    and deferred tax assets, as well as other changes in income tax
    laws, are recognized in net earnings in the period during which
    such changes are enacted. Valuation allowances are established
    when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts
    expected to be realized. Merrill Lynch assesses its ability to
    realize deferred tax assets primarily based on the earnings
    history and other factors of the legal entities through which
    the deferred tax assets will be realized as discussed in
    SFAS No. 109. See Note 14 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further discussion of income taxes.

 

    Merrill Lynch recognizes and measures its unrecognized tax
    benefits in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48,
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. Merrill Lynch
    estimates the likelihood, based on their technical merits, that
    tax positions will be sustained upon examination based on the
    facts and circumstances and information available at the end of
    each period. Merrill Lynch adjusts the level of unrecognized tax
    benefits when there is more information available, or when an
    event occurs requiring a change. The reassessment of
    unrecognized tax benefits could have a material impact on
    Merrill Lynchs effective tax rate in the period in which
    it occurs.

 

    ML & Co. and certain of its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax
    return. Certain other Merrill Lynch entities file tax returns in
    their local jurisdictions.

 










   Variable
    Interest Entities and Qualified Special Purpose Entities
    




    In the normal course of business, Merrill Lynch enters into a
    variety of transactions with VIEs. The applicable accounting
    guidance requires Merrill Lynch to perform a qualitative
    and/or
    quantitative analysis of a VIE to determine whether it is the
    primary beneficiary of the VIE and therefore must consolidate
    the VIE. In performing this analysis, Merrill Lynch makes
    assumptions regarding future





  
  
  
  
  




 


 


    page 91


 












Table of Contents


    performance of assets held by the VIE, taking into account
    estimates of credit risk, estimates of the fair value of assets,
    timing of cash flows, and other significant factors. It should
    also be noted that although a VIEs actual results may
    differ from projected outcomes, a revised consolidation analysis
    is not required unless a reconsideration event occurs. If a VIE
    meets the conditions to be considered a QSPE, it is typically
    not required to be consolidated by Merrill Lynch. A QSPEs
    activities must be significantly limited. A servicer of the
    assets held by a QSPE may have discretion in restructuring or
    working out assets held by the QSPE as long as the discretion is
    significantly limited and the parameters of that discretion are
    fully described in the legal documents that established the
    QSPE. Determining whether the activities of a QSPE and its
    servicer meet these conditions requires the use of judgment by
    management.

 










   Goodwill
    and Intangibles
    




    Merrill Lynch makes certain subjective and complex judgments
    with respect to its goodwill and intangible assets. These
    include assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair
    value of its reporting units. Reporting unit fair value is
    measured based on the market approach, using market-multiple
    analyses. Merrill Lynch also makes assumptions and estimates in
    valuing its intangible assets and determining the useful lives
    of its intangible assets with definite lives.

 










   Employee
    Stock Options
    




    The fair value of stock options with vesting based solely on
    service requirements is estimated as of the grant date based on
    a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of stock
    options with vesting that is partially dependent on
    pre-determined increases in the price of Merrill Lynchs
    common stock is estimated as of the grant date using a lattice
    option pricing model. These models take into account the
    exercise price and expected life of the option, the current
    price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility,
    expected dividends, and the risk-free interest rate for the
    expected term of the option. Judgment is required in determining
    certain of the inputs to the model. The expected life of the
    option is based on an analysis of historical employee exercise
    behavior. The expected volatility is based on Merrill
    Lynchs historical monthly stock price volatility for the
    same number of months as the expected life of the option. The
    fair value of the option estimated at grant date is not adjusted
    for subsequent changes in assumptions.

Cash and Cash
    Equivalents


    Merrill Lynch defines cash equivalents as short-term, highly
    liquid securities, federal funds sold, and interest-earning
    deposits with maturities, when purchased, of 90 days or
    less, that are not used for trading purposes. The amounts
    recognized for cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets approximate fair value amounts.

 

Cash and
    Securities Segregated for Regulatory Purposes or Deposited with
    Clearing Organizations


    Merrill Lynch maintains relationships with clients around the
    world and, as a result, it is subject to various regulatory
    regimes. As a result of its client activities, Merrill Lynch is
    obligated by rules mandated by its primary regulators, including
    the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the
    Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the
    United States and the Financial Services Authority
    (FSA) in the United Kingdom to segregate or set
    aside cash
    and/or
    qualified securities to satisfy these regulations, which have
    been promulgated to protect customer assets. In addition,
    Merrill Lynch is a member of various clearing organizations at
    which it maintains cash
    and/or
    securities required for the conduct of its day-to-day clearance
    activities. The amounts recognized for cash and securities
    segregated for regulatory purposes or deposited with clearing
    organizations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets approximate
    fair value amounts.

 

Securities
    Financing Transactions


    Merrill Lynch enters into repurchase and resale agreements and
    securities borrowed and loaned transactions to accommodate
    customers and earn residual interest rate spreads (also referred
    to as matched-book transactions), obtain securities
    for settlement and finance inventory positions. Merrill Lynch
    also engages in securities financing for customers through
    margin lending (see the Customer Receivables and Payables
    section).

 

    Resale and repurchase agreements are accounted for as
    collateralized financing transactions and may be recorded at
    their contractual amounts plus accrued interest or at fair value
    under the fair value option election in SFAS No. 159.
    Resale and repurchase agreements recorded at fair value are
    generally valued based on pricing models that use inputs with
    observable levels of price transparency. Changes in the fair
    value of resale and repurchase agreements are reflected in
    principal transactions revenues and the contractual interest
    coupon is recorded as interest revenue or interest expense,
    respectively. For further information refer to Note 3 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements. Resale and repurchase
    agreements recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued
    interest approximate fair value, as the fair value of these
    items is not materially sensitive to shifts in market interest
    rates because of the short-term nature of these instruments or
    to credit risk because the resale and repurchase agreements are
    fully collateralized.

 

    Merrill Lynchs policy is to obtain possession of
    collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the
    principal amount loaned under resale agreements. To ensure that
    the market value of the underlying collateral remains
    sufficient, collateral is valued daily and Merrill Lynch may
    require counterparties to deposit additional collateral or may
    return collateral pledged when appropriate.

Table of Contents


    Substantially all repurchase and resale activities are
    transacted under master netting agreements that give Merrill
    Lynch the right, in the event of default, to liquidate
    collateral held and to offset receivables and payables with the
    same counterparty. Merrill Lynch offsets certain repurchase and
    resale agreement balances with the same counterparty on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 

    Merrill Lynch may use securities received as collateral for
    resale agreements to satisfy regulatory requirements such as
    Rule 15c3-3
    of the SEC.

 

    Securities borrowed and loaned transactions are recorded at the
    amount of cash collateral advanced or received. Securities
    borrowed transactions require Merrill Lynch to provide the
    counterparty with collateral in the form of cash, letters of
    credit, or other securities. Merrill Lynch receives collateral
    in the form of cash or other securities for securities loaned
    transactions. For these transactions, the fees received or paid
    by Merrill Lynch are recorded as interest revenue or expense. On
    a daily basis, Merrill Lynch monitors the market value of
    securities borrowed or loaned against the collateral value, and
    Merrill Lynch may require counterparties to deposit additional
    collateral or may return collateral pledged, when appropriate.
    The carrying value of these instruments approximates fair value
    as these items are not materially sensitive to shifts in market
    interest rates because of their short-term nature
    and/or their
    variable interest rates.

 

    All firm-owned securities pledged to counterparties where the
    counterparty has the right, by contract or custom, to sell or
    repledge the securities are disclosed parenthetically in trading
    assets or, if applicable, in investment securities on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 

    In transactions where Merrill Lynch acts as the lender in a
    securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be
    pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets carried at fair value, representing
    the securities received (securities received as collateral), and
    a liability for the same amount, representing the obligation to
    return those securities (obligation to return securities
    received as collateral). The amounts on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets result from non-cash transactions.

 

Trading Assets
    and Liabilities


    Merrill Lynchs trading activities consist primarily of
    securities brokerage and trading; derivatives dealing and
    brokerage; commodities trading and futures brokerage; and
    securities financing transactions. Trading assets and trading
    liabilities consist of cash instruments (e.g. securities and
    loans) and derivative instruments used for trading purposes or
    for managing risk exposures in other trading inventory. See the
    Derivatives section for additional information on accounting
    policy for derivatives. Trading assets and trading liabilities
    also include commodities inventory.

 

    Trading assets and liabilities are generally recorded on a trade
    date basis at fair value. Included in trading liabilities are
    securities that Merrill Lynch has sold but did not own and will
    therefore be obligated to purchase at a future date (short
    sales). Commodities inventory is recorded at the lower of
    cost or market value. Changes in fair value of trading assets
    and liabilities (i.e., unrealized gains and losses) are
    recognized as principal transactions revenues in the current
    period. Realized gains and losses and any related interest
    amounts are included in principal transactions revenues and
    interest revenues and expenses, depending on the nature of the
    instrument.

 

Derivatives


    A derivative is an instrument whose value is derived from an
    underlying instrument or index, such as interest rates, equity
    securities, currencies, commodities or credit spreads.
    Derivatives include futures, forwards, swaps, or option
    contracts, or other financial instruments with similar
    characteristics. Derivative contracts often involve future
    commitments to exchange interest payment streams or currencies
    based on a notional or contractual amount (e.g., interest rate
    swaps or currency forwards) or to purchase or sell other
    financial instruments at specified terms on a specified date
    (e.g., options to buy or sell securities or currencies).
    Derivative activity is subject to Merrill Lynchs overall
    risk management policies and procedures.

 

    SFAS No. 133, as amended, establishes accounting and
    reporting standards for derivative instruments, including
    certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts
    (embedded derivatives) and for hedging activities.
    SFAS No. 133 requires that an entity recognize all
    derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and measure those instruments at fair value. The
    fair value of all derivatives is recorded on a
    net-by-counterparty
    basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets where management
    believes a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable
    netting agreement.

 

    The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative
    instrument depends on its intended use and if it is designated
    and qualifies as an accounting hedging instrument.

 

    Merrill Lynch enters into derivatives to facilitate client
    transactions, for proprietary trading and financing purposes,
    and to manage risk exposures arising from trading assets and
    liabilities. Derivatives entered into for these purposes are
    recognized at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as
    trading assets and liabilities, and changes in fair value are
    reported in current period earnings as principal transactions
    revenues.

Table of Contents


    Merrill Lynch also enters into derivatives in order to manage
    risk exposures arising from assets and liabilities not carried
    at fair value as follows:

 






    1. 

    Merrill Lynch routinely issues debt in a variety of maturities
    and currencies to achieve the lowest cost financing possible. In
    addition, Merrill Lynchs regulated bank entities accept
    time deposits of varying rates and maturities. Merrill Lynch
    enters into derivative transactions to hedge these liabilities.
    Derivatives used most frequently include swap agreements that:



 







 
     


    Convert fixed-rate interest payments into variable payments;


 

 
     


    Change the underlying interest rate basis or reset frequency; and


 

 
     


    Change the settlement currency of a debt instrument.



 






    2. 

    Merrill Lynch enters into hedges on marketable investment
    securities to manage the interest rate risk, currency risk, and
    net duration of its investment portfolios.


 

    3. 

    Merrill Lynch has fair value hedges of long-term fixed rate
    resale and repurchase agreements to manage the interest rate
    risk of these assets and liabilities. Subsequent to the adoption
    of SFAS No. 159, Merrill Lynch elects to account for
    these instruments on a fair value basis rather than apply hedge
    accounting.


 

    4. 

    Merrill Lynch uses foreign-exchange forward contracts,
    foreign-exchange options, currency swaps, and
    foreign-currency-denominated debt to hedge its net investments
    in foreign operations. These derivatives and cash instruments
    are used to mitigate the impact of changes in exchange rates.


 

    5. 

    Merrill Lynch enters into futures, swaps, options and forward
    contracts to manage the price risk of certain commodity
    inventory.



 

    Derivatives entered into by Merrill Lynch to hedge its funding,
    marketable investment securities and net investments in foreign
    subsidiaries are reported at fair value in other assets or
    interest and other payables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    Derivatives used to hedge commodity inventory are included in
    trading assets and trading liabilities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

 

    Derivatives that qualify as accounting hedges under the guidance
    in SFAS No. 133 are designated as one of the following:

 






    1. 

    A hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability
    (fair value hedge). Changes in the fair value of
    derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges
    of interest rate risk, along with the gain or loss on the hedged
    asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are
    recorded in current period earnings as interest revenue or
    expense. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are
    designated and qualify as fair value hedges of commodity price
    risk, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or
    liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded
    in current period earnings in principal transactions.


 

    2. 

    A hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid
    related to a recognized asset or liability (cash
    flow hedge). Changes in the fair value of derivatives that
    are designated and qualify as effective cash flow hedges are
    recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss until earnings
    are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged
    asset or liability (e.g., when periodic interest accruals on a
    variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings).


 

    3. 

    A hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in
    the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as
    hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are recorded
    in the foreign currency translation adjustment account within
    accumulated other comprehensive loss. Changes in the fair value
    of the hedge instruments that are associated with the difference
    between the spot translation rate and the forward translation
    rate are recorded in current period earnings in other revenues.



 

    Merrill Lynch formally assesses, both at the inception of the
    hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging derivatives
    are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash
    flows of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative
    is not highly effective as a hedge, Merrill Lynch discontinues
    hedge accounting. Under the provisions of
    SFAS No. 133, 100% hedge effectiveness is assumed for
    those derivatives whose terms meet the conditions of
    SFAS No. 133 short-cut method.

 

    As noted above, Merrill Lynch enters into fair value and cash
    flow hedges of interest rate exposure associated with certain
    investment securities and debt issuances. Merrill Lynch uses
    interest rate swaps to hedge this exposure. Hedge effectiveness
    testing is required for certain of these hedging relationships
    on a quarterly basis. For fair value hedges, Merrill Lynch
    assesses effectiveness on a prospective basis by comparing the
    expected change in the price of the hedge instrument to the
    expected change in the value of the hedged item under various
    interest rate shock scenarios. For cash flow hedges, Merrill
    Lynch assesses effectiveness on a prospective basis by comparing
    the present value of the projected cash flows on the variable
    leg of the hedge instrument against the present value of the
    projected cash flows of the hedged item (the change in
    variable cash flows method) under various interest rate,
    prepayment and credit shock scenarios. In addition, Merrill
    Lynch assesses effectiveness on a retrospective basis using the
    dollar-offset ratio approach. When assessing hedge
    effectiveness, there are no attributes of the derivatives used
    to hedge the fair value exposure that are excluded from the
    assessment. Ineffectiveness associated with these hedges was
    immaterial for all periods presented. The deferred net gains on
    derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges that were
    in accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 28,
    2007 and are expected to be reclassified into earnings during
    2008 is approximately $44 million.





  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report

Table of Contents


    Merrill Lynch also enters into fair value hedges of commodity
    price risk associated with certain commodity inventory. For
    these hedges, Merrill Lynch assesses effectiveness on a
    prospective and retrospective basis using regression techniques.
    The difference between the spot rate and the contracted forward
    rate which represents the time value of money is excluded from
    the assessment of hedge effectiveness and is recorded in
    principal transactions revenues. The amount of ineffectiveness
    related to these hedges reported in earnings was not material
    for all periods presented.

 

    For hedges of net investments in foreign operations,
    $432 million and $1.1 billion of net losses related to
    non-U.S. dollar
    hedges of investments in
    non-U.S. dollar
    subsidiaries were included in accumulated other comprehensive
    loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the years ended 2007
    and 2006, respectively. These amounts were substantially offset
    by net gains on the hedged investments.

 

Derivatives
    that Contain a Significant Financing Element


    In the ordinary course of trading activities, Merrill Lynch
    enters into certain transactions that are documented as
    derivatives where a significant cash investment is made by one
    party. These transactions can be in the form of simple interest
    rate swaps where the fixed leg is prepaid or may be in the form
    of equity-linked or credit-linked transactions where the initial
    investment equals the notional amount of the derivative. Certain
    derivative instruments entered into or modified after
    June 30, 2003 that contain a significant financing element
    at inception and where Merrill Lynch is deemed to be the
    borrower, are included in financing activities in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In addition, the cash
    flows from all other derivative transactions that do not contain
    a significant financing element at inception are included in
    operating activities.

 

Investment
    Securities


    Investment securities consist of marketable investment
    securities and non-qualifying investments. Refer to Note 5
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 

Marketable
    Investments


    ML & Co. and certain of its non-broker-dealer
    subsidiaries follow the guidance prescribed by
    SFAS No. 115 when accounting for investments in debt
    and publicly traded equity securities. Merrill Lynch classifies
    those debt securities that it has the intent and ability to hold
    to maturity as held-to-maturity securities. Held-to-maturity
    securities are carried at cost unless a decline in value is
    deemed other-than-temporary, in which case the carrying value is
    reduced. For Merrill Lynch, the trading classification under
    SFAS No. 115 generally includes those securities that
    are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them
    in the near term, securities that are economically hedged, or
    securities that contain a bifurcatable embedded derivative as
    defined in SFAS No. 133. Securities classified as
    trading are marked to fair value through earnings. All other
    qualifying securities are classified as available-for-sale with
    unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other
    comprehensive loss. Any unrealized losses deemed
    other-than-temporary are included in current period earnings and
    removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss.

 

    Realized gains and losses on investment securities are included
    in current period earnings. For purposes of computing realized
    gains and losses, the cost basis of each investment sold is
    generally based on the average cost method.

 

    Investment securities are reviewed at least quarterly to assess
    whether any impairment is other-than-temporary. The
    determination of other-than-temporary impairment requires
    judgment and will depend on several factors, including but not
    limited to the severity and duration of the decline in value of
    the investment securities and the financial condition of the
    issuer. Merrill Lynchs impairment review generally
    includes:

 






     

    Identifying investments with indicators of possible impairment;


 

     

    Analyzing individual investments with fair value less than
    amortized cost, including estimating future cash flows, and
    considering the length of time and extent to which the
    investment has been in an unrealized loss position;


 

     

    Discussion of evidential matter, including an evaluation of
    factors or triggers that could cause individual investments to
    qualify as having other-than-temporary impairment; and


 

     

    Documenting the analysis and conclusions.



 

    To the extent that Merrill Lynch has the ability and intent to
    hold the investments for a period of time sufficient for a
    forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the
    investment, no impairment charge will be recognized.

 

Non-Qualifying
    Investments


    Non-qualifying investments are those investments that are not
    within the scope of SFAS No. 115 and primarily include
    private equity investments accounted for at fair value and
    securities carried at cost or under the equity method of
    accounting.

 

    Private equity investments that are held for capital
    appreciation
    and/or
    current income are accounted for under the AICPA Accounting and
    Auditing Guide, Investment Companies (the
    Investment Company Guide) and carried at fair value.
    Additionally, certain private equity investments that are not
    accounted for under the Investment Company Guide may be carried
    at fair value under the fair value option

election in SFAS No. 159.
    The carrying value of private equity investments reflects
    expected exit values based upon market prices or other valuation
    methodologies including expected cash flows and market
    comparables of similar companies.
    

 

    Merrill Lynch has minority investments in the common shares of
    corporations and in partnerships that do not fall within the
    scope of SFAS No. 115 or the Investment Company Guide.
    Merrill Lynch accounts for these investments using either the
    cost or the equity method of accounting based on
    managements ability to influence the investees (See
    Consolidation Accounting Policies section for more information).

 

    For investments accounted for using the equity method, income is
    recognized based on Merrill Lynchs share of the earnings
    or losses of the investee. Dividend distributions are generally
    recorded as reductions in the investment balance. Impairment
    testing is based on the guidance provided in  APB Opinion
    No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments
    in Common Stock, and the investment is reduced when an
    impairment is deemed other-than-temporary.

 

    For investments accounted for at cost, income is recognized as
    dividends are received. Impairment testing is based on the
    guidance provided in FASB Staff Position Nos. SFAS 115-1
    and
    SFAS 124-1,
The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its
    Application to Certain Investments, and the cost basis is
    reduced when an impairment is deemed other-than-temporary.

 

Loans, Notes, and
    Mortgages, Net


    Merrill Lynchs lending and related activities include loan
    originations, syndications, and securitizations. Loan
    originations include corporate and institutional loans,
    residential and commercial mortgages, asset-based loans, and
    other loans to individuals and businesses. Merrill Lynch also
    engages in secondary market loan trading and margin lending (see
    Trading Assets and Liabilities and Customer Receivables and
    Payables sections, respectively). Loans included in loans,
    notes, and mortgages are classified for accounting purposes as
    loans held for investment and loans held for sale.

 

    Loans held for investment are carried at amortized cost, less an
    allowance for loan losses. The provision for loan losses is
    based on managements estimate of the amount necessary to
    maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to
    absorb probable incurred loan losses and is included in interest
    revenue in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss)/Earnings.
    Managements estimate of loan losses is influenced by many
    factors, including adverse situations that may affect the
    borrowers ability to repay, current economic conditions,
    prior loan loss experience, and the estimated fair value of any
    underlying collateral. The fair value of collateral is generally
    determined by third-party appraisals in the case of residential
    mortgages, quoted market prices for securities, or other types
    of estimates for other assets.

 

    Managements estimate of loan losses includes judgment
    about collectibility based on available information at the
    balance sheet date, and the uncertainties inherent in those
    underlying assumptions. While management has based its estimates
    on the best information available, future adjustments to the
    allowance for loan losses may be necessary as a result of
    changes in the economic environment or variances between actual
    results and the original assumptions.

 

    In general, loans are evaluated for impairment when they are
    greater than 90 days past due or exhibit credit quality
    weakness. Loans are considered impaired when it is probable that
    Merrill Lynch will not be able to collect the contractual
    principal and interest due from the borrower. All payments
    received on impaired loans are applied to principal until the
    principal balance has been reduced to a level where collection
    of the remaining recorded investment is not in doubt. Typically,
    when collection of principal on an impaired loan is not in
    doubt, contractual interest will be credited to interest income
    when received.

 

    Loans held for sale are carried at lower of cost or fair value
    and loans for which the fair value option has been elected are
    carried at fair value; estimation is required in determining
    these fair values. The fair value of loans made in connection
    with commercial lending activity, consisting primarily of senior
    debt, is primarily estimated using discounted cash flows or the
    market value of publicly issued debt instruments. Merrill
    Lynchs estimate of fair value for other loans, notes, and
    mortgages is determined based on the individual loan
    characteristics. For certain homogeneous categories of loans,
    including residential mortgages, automobile loans, and home
    equity loans, fair value is estimated using an as-if
    securitized price based on estimated performance of the
    underlying asset pool collateral, rating agency credit structure
    assumptions and market pricing for similar securitizations
    previously executed. Declines in the carrying value of loans
    held for sale and loans accounted for at fair value under the
    fair value option are included in other revenues in the
    Consolidated Statements of (Loss)/Earnings.

 

    Nonrefundable loan origination fees, loan commitment fees, and
    draw down fees received in conjunction with
    financing arrangements are generally deferred and recognized
    over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment to the
    yield. If, at the outset, or any time during the term of the
    loan, it becomes highly probable that the repayment period will
    be extended, the amortization is recalculated using the expected
    remaining life of the loan. When the loan contract does not
    provide for a specific maturity date, managements best
    estimate of the repayment period is used. At repayment of the
    loan, any unrecognized deferred fee is immediately recognized in
    earnings. If the loan is accounted for as held for sale, the
    fees received are deferred and recognized as part of the gain or
    loss on sale in other revenues. If

    the loan is accounted for under the fair value option, the fees
    are included in the determination of the fair value and included
    in other revenue.

 

Other Receivables
    and Payables

 

Customer
    Receivables and Payables


    Customer securities transactions are recorded on a settlement
    date basis. Receivables from and payables to customers include
    amounts due on cash and margin transactions, including futures
    contracts transacted on behalf of Merrill Lynch customers. Due
    to their short-term nature, such amounts approximate fair value.
    Securities owned by customers, including those that
    collateralize margin or other similar transactions, are not
    reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 

Brokers and
    Dealers Receivables and Payables


    Receivables from brokers and dealers include amounts receivable
    for securities not delivered by Merrill Lynch to a purchaser by
    the settlement date (fails to deliver), margin
    deposits, commissions, and net receivables arising from
    unsettled trades. Payables to brokers and dealers include
    amounts payable for securities not received by Merrill Lynch
    from a seller by the settlement date (fails to
    receive). Brokers and dealers receivables and payables
    also include amounts related to futures contracts on behalf of
    Merrill Lynch customers as well as net payables and receivables
    from unsettled trades. Due to their short-term nature, the
    amounts recognized for brokers and dealers receivables and
    payables approximate fair value.

 

Interest and
    Other Receivables and Payables


    Interest and other receivables include interest receivable on
    corporate and governmental obligations, customer or other
    receivables, and stock-borrowed transactions. Also included are
    receivables from income taxes, underwriting and advisory fees,
    commissions and fees, and other receivables. Interest and other
    payables include interest payable for stock-loaned transactions,
    and short-term and long-term borrowings. Also included are
    amounts payable for employee compensation and benefits, income
    taxes, minority interest, non-trading derivatives, dividends,
    other reserves, and other payables.

 

Equipment and
    Facilities


    Equipment and facilities consist primarily of technology
    hardware and software, leasehold improvements, and owned
    facilities. Equipment and facilities are reported at historical
    cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, except
    for land, which is reported at historical cost.

 

    Depreciation and amortization are computed using the
    straight-line method. Equipment is depreciated over its
    estimated useful life, while leasehold improvements are
    amortized over the lesser of the improvements estimated
    economic useful life or the term of the lease. Maintenance and
    repair costs are expensed as incurred.

 

    Included in the occupancy and related depreciation expense
    category was depreciation and amortization of $258 million,
    $216 million, and $198 million in 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively. Depreciation and amortization recognized in
    the communications and technology expense category was
    $394 million, $303 million, and $271 million for
    2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

 

    Qualifying costs incurred in the development of internal-use
    software are capitalized when costs exceed $5 million and
    are amortized over the useful life of the developed software,
    generally not exceeding three years.

 

Goodwill


    Goodwill is the cost of an acquired company in excess of the
    fair value of identifiable net assets at acquisition date.
    Goodwill is tested annually (or more frequently under certain
    conditions) for impairment at the reporting unit level in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142).

 

Intangible
    Assets


    Intangible assets consist primarily of value assigned to
    customer relationships and core deposits. Intangible assets are
    tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144,
    Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
    Assets (SFAS No. 144), whenever certain
    conditions exist which would indicate the carrying amount of
    such assets may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with
    definitive lives are amortized over their respective estimated
    useful lives.

 

Other
    Assets


    Other assets include unrealized gains on derivatives used to
    hedge Merrill Lynchs non-trading borrowing and investing
    activities. All of these derivatives are recorded at fair value
    with changes reflected in earnings or accumulated other
    comprehensive loss (refer to the Derivatives section for more
    information). Other assets also include prepaid pension expense
    related to plan contributions in excess of obligations, other
    prepaid expenses, and other deferred charges. Refer to
    Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information.

    In addition, real estate purchased for investment purposes is
    also included in this category. Real estate held in this
    category may be classified as either held and used or held for
    sale depending on the facts and circumstances. Real estate held
    and used is valued at cost, less depreciation, and real estate
    held for sale is valued at the lower of cost or fair value, less
    estimated cost to sell.

 

Deposits


    Savings deposits are interest-bearing accounts that have no
    maturity or expiration date, whereby the depositor is not
    required by the deposit contract, but may at any time be
    required by the depository institution, to give written notice
    of an intended withdrawal not less than seven days before
    withdrawal is made. Time deposits are accounts that have a
    stipulated maturity and interest rate. Depositors holding time
    deposits may recover their funds prior to the stated maturity
    but may pay a penalty to do so. In certain cases, Merrill Lynch
    enters into interest rate swaps to hedge the fair value risk in
    these time deposits. The carrying amount of deposits
    approximates fair value amounts. Refer to the Derivatives
    section for more information.

 

Short- and
    Long-Term Borrowings


    Merrill Lynchs general-purpose funding is principally
    obtained from medium-term and long-term borrowings. Commercial
    paper, when issued at a discount, is recorded at the proceeds
    received and accreted to its par value. Long-term borrowings are
    carried at either the principal amount borrowed, net of
    unamortized discounts or premiums, adjusted for the effects of
    fair value hedges or fair value if it has been elected under
    SFAS No. 159.

 

    Merrill Lynch issues structured debt instruments that have
    coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or
    equity securities, indices, currencies, or commodities,
    generally referred to as hybrid debt instruments or structured
    notes. The contingent payment components of these obligations
    may meet the definition in SFAS No. 133 of an
    embedded derivative. Historically, these hybrid debt
    instruments were assessed to determine if the embedded
    derivative required separate reporting (i.e. bifurcation) and
    accounting, and if so, the embedded derivative was accounted for
    at fair value and reported in long-term borrowings on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets along with the debt obligation.
    Changes in the fair value of the bifurcated embedded derivative
    and related economic hedges were reported in principal
    transactions revenues. Separating an embedded derivative from
    its host contract required careful analysis, judgment, and an
    understanding of the terms and conditions of the instrument.
    Beginning in the first quarter of 2007, Merrill Lynch elected
    the fair value option in SFAS No. 159 for all hybrid
    debt instruments issued subsequent to December 29, 2006.
    Changes in fair value of the entire hybrid debt instrument are
    reflected in principal transactions revenues and the contractual
    interest coupon, if any, is recorded as interest expense. For
    further information refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

 

    Merrill Lynch uses derivatives to manage the interest rate,
    currency, equity, and other risk exposures of its borrowings.
    See the Derivatives section for additional information on
    accounting policy for derivatives.

 










   Stock-Based
    Compensation
    




    Merrill Lynch adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123
    (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment, a revision of
    SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation (SFAS No. 123R) beginning
    in the first quarter of 2006. Under SFAS No. 123R,
    compensation expenses for share-based awards that do not require
    future service are recorded immediately, and share-based awards
    that require future service continue to be amortized into
    expense over the relevant service period. Merrill Lynch adopted
    SFAS No. 123R under the modified prospective method
    whereby the provisions of SFAS No. 123R are generally
    applied only to share-based awards granted or modified
    subsequent to adoption. Thus, for Merrill Lynch,
    SFAS No. 123R required the immediate expensing of
    share-based awards granted or modified in 2006 to
    retirement-eligible employees, including awards that are subject
    to non-compete provisions.

 

    Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, Merrill Lynch
    had recognized expense for share-based compensation over the
    vesting period stipulated in the grant for all employees. This
    included those who had satisfied retirement eligibility criteria
    but were subject to a non-compete agreement that applied from
    the date of retirement through each applicable vesting period.
    Previously, Merrill Lynch had accelerated any unrecognized
    compensation cost for such awards if a retirement-eligible
    employee left Merrill Lynch. However, because
    SFAS No. 123R applies only to awards granted or
    modified in 2006, and thereafter, expenses for share-based
    awards granted prior to 2006 to employees who were
    retirement-eligible with respect to those awards must continue
    to be amortized over the stated vesting period.

 










   New
    Accounting Pronouncements
    




    In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,
    Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements-an amendment of ARB No. 51
    (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160
    requires noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries initially to
    be measured at fair value and classified as a separate component
    of equity. Under SFAS No. 160, gains or losses on
    sales of noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries are not
    recognized, instead sales of noncontrolling interests are
    accounted for as equity transactions. However, in a sale of a
    subsidiarys shares that results in the deconsolidation of
    the subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized for the difference
    between the proceeds of that sale and the carrying amount of the
    interest sold. Additionally, a new fair value basis is
    established for any remaining ownership interest.
    SFAS No. 160 is effective for Merrill Lynch beginning
    in 2009; earlier application is prohibited.
    SFAS No. 160 is required to be adopted

prospectively, with the exception
    of certain presentation and disclosure requirements (e.g.,
    reclassifying noncontrolling interests to appear in equity),
    which are required to be adopted retrospectively. We are
    currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 160 on the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.
    

 

    In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R,
    Business Combinations
    (SFAS No. 141R), which significantly
    changes the financial accounting and reporting for business
    combinations. SFAS No. 141R will require:

 






     

    More assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the
    acquisition date,


 

     

    Liabilities related to contingent consideration to be remeasured
    at fair value in each subsequent reporting period with changes
    reflected in earnings and not goodwill, and


 

     

    An acquirer in pre-acquisition periods to expense all
    acquisition-related costs.



 

    SFAS No. 141R is required to be adopted on a
    prospective basis concurrently with SFAS No. 160 and
    is effective for business combinations with an acquisition date
    in fiscal 2009. Early adoption is prohibited. We are currently
    evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 141R on the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

 

    In June 2007, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee of
    the AICPA issued Statement of Position
    07-1,
Clarification of the Scope of the Audit and Accounting Guide
    Investment Companies and Accounting by Parent Companies and
    Equity Method Investors for Investments in Investment Companies
    (SOP 07-1).
    The intent of
    SOP 07-1
    is to clarify which entities are within the scope of the AICPA
    Audit and Accounting Guide, Investment Companies (the
    Guide). For those entities that are investment
    companies under
    SOP 07-1,
    the SOP also addresses whether the specialized industry
    accounting principles of the Guide (referred to as
    investment company accounting) should be retained by
    the parent company in consolidation or by an investor that
    accounts for the investment under the equity method because it
    has significant influence over the investee. On October 17,
    2007, the FASB proposed an indefinite delay of the effective
    dates of
    SOP 07-1
    to allow the Board to address certain implementation issues that
    have arisen and possibly revise
    SOP 07-1.

 

    In April 2007, the FASB issued FSP
    No. FIN 39-1,
Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39 (FSP
    FIN 39-1).
    FSP
    FIN 39-1
    modifies FIN No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related
    to Certain Contracts, and permits companies to offset cash
    collateral receivables or payables with net derivative
    positions. FSP
    FIN 39-1
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007 with early adoption permitted. FSP
    FIN 39-1
    will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial
    Statements as it clarified the acceptability of existing market
    practice, which we apply, for netting of cash collateral against
    net derivative assets and liabilities.

 

    In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, which
    provides a fair value option election that allows companies to
    irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent
    measurement attribute for certain financial assets and
    liabilities. Changes in fair value for assets and liabilities
    for which the election is made will be recognized in earnings as
    they occur. SFAS No. 159 permits the fair value option
    election on an
    instrument-by-instrument
    basis at initial recognition of an asset or liability or upon an
    event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that
    instrument. SFAS No. 159 is effective as of the
    beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins
    after November 15, 2007. Early adoption is permitted as of
    the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before
    November 15, 2007 provided that the entity makes that
    choice in the first 120 days of that fiscal year, has not
    yet issued financial statements for any interim period of the
    fiscal year of adoption, and also elects to apply the provisions
    of SFAS No. 157 (described below). We early adopted
    SFAS No. 159 in the first quarter of 2007. In
    connection with this adoption management reviewed its treasury
    liquidity portfolio and determined that we should decrease our
    economic exposure to interest rate risk by eliminating long-term
    fixed rate assets from the portfolio and replacing them with
    floating rate assets. The fixed rate assets had been classified
    as available-for-sale and the unrealized losses related to such
    assets had been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
    loss. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 159, the
    loss related to these assets was removed from accumulated other
    comprehensive loss and a loss of approximately
    $185 million, net of tax, primarily related to these
    assets, was recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to
    beginning retained earnings, with no material impact to total
    stockholders equity. Refer to Note 3 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

 

    In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157.
    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value
    hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair
    value and enhances disclosure about fair value measurements.
    SFAS No. 157 nullifies the guidance provided by
    EITF 02-3
    that prohibits recognition of day one gains or losses on
    derivative transactions where model inputs that significantly
    impact valuation are not observable. In addition,
    SFAS No. 157 prohibits the use of block discounts for
    large positions of unrestricted financial instruments that trade
    in an active market and requires an issuer to incorporate
    changes in its own credit spreads when determining the fair
    value of its liabilities. SFAS No. 157 is effective
    for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 with
    early adoption permitted provided that the entity has not yet
    issued financial statements for that fiscal year, including any
    interim periods. The provisions of SFAS No. 157 are to
    be applied prospectively, except that the provisions related to
    block discounts and existing derivative financial instruments
    measured under
    EITF 02-3
    are to be applied as a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to
    opening retained earnings in the year of adoption. We early
    adopted SFAS No. 157 in the first quarter of 2007. The
    cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings was
    an increase of approximately $53 million, net of tax,

    primarily representing the difference between the carrying
    amounts and fair value of derivative contracts valued using the
    guidance in
    EITF 02-3.
    The impact of adopting SFAS No. 157 was not material
    to our Consolidated Statement of (Loss)/Earnings. Refer to
    Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional information.

 

    In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,
    Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106 and 132R
    (SFAS No. 158). SFAS No. 158
    requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded
    status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan
    assets and the benefit obligation as an asset or liability in
    its statement of financial condition. Upon adoption,
    SFAS No. 158 requires an entity to recognize
    previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior
    service costs within accumulated other comprehensive loss, net
    of tax. In accordance with the guidance in
    SFAS No. 158, we adopted this provision of the
    standard for year-end 2006. The adoption of
    SFAS No. 158 resulted in a net credit of
    $65 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss
    recorded on the Consolidated Financial Statements at
    December 29, 2006. SFAS No. 158 also requires
    defined benefit plan assets and benefit obligations to be
    measured as of the date of the companys fiscal year-end.
    We have historically used a September 30 measurement date. Under
    the provisions of SFAS No. 158, we will be required to
    change our measurement date to coincide with our fiscal
    year-end. This provision of SFAS No. 158 will be
    effective for us in fiscal 2008. We are currently evaluating the
    impact of adoption of this provision of SFAS No. 158
    on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation
    of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48).
    FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income
    taxes recognized in a companys financial statements and
    prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for
    the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax
    position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The
    Interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition,
    classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
    periods, disclosure and transition. We adopted FIN 48 in
    the first quarter of 2007. The impact of the adoption of
    FIN 48 resulted in a decrease to beginning retained
    earnings and an increase to the liability for unrecognized tax
    benefits of approximately $66 million. See Note 14 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 

    In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting
    for Servicing of Financial Assets
    (SFAS No. 156). SFAS No. 156
    amends SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities, to require all separately recognized servicing
    assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at
    fair value, if practicable. SFAS No. 156 also permits
    servicers to subsequently measure each separate class of
    servicing assets and liabilities at fair value rather than at
    the lower of amortized cost or market. For those companies that
    elect to measure their servicing assets and liabilities at fair
    value, SFAS No. 156 requires the difference between
    the carrying value and fair value at the date of adoption to be
    recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
    earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the
    election is made. Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 156 we
    accounted for servicing assets and servicing liabilities at the
    lower of amortized cost or market. We adopted
    SFAS No. 156 on December 30, 2006. We have not
    elected to subsequently fair value those mortgage servicing
    rights (MSR) held as of the date of adoption or
    those MSRs acquired or retained after December 30, 2006.
    The adoption of SFAS No. 156 did not have a material
    impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140
    (SFAS No. 155). SFAS No. 155
    clarifies the bifurcation requirements for certain financial
    instruments and permits hybrid financial instruments that
    contain a bifurcatable embedded derivative to be accounted for
    as a single financial instrument at fair value with changes in
    fair value recognized in earnings. This election is permitted on
    an
    instrument-by-instrument
    basis for all hybrid financial instruments held, obtained, or
    issued as of the adoption date. At adoption, any difference
    between the total carrying amount of the individual components
    of the existing bifurcated hybrid financial instruments and the
    fair value of the combined hybrid financial instruments is
    recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning
    retained earnings. We adopted SFAS No. 155 on a
    prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2007. Since
    SFAS No. 159 incorporates accounting and disclosure
    requirements that are similar to SFAS No. 155, we
    apply SFAS No. 159, rather than
    SFAS No. 155, to our fair value elections for hybrid
    financial instruments.

 

    Merrill Lynch adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R
    as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2006. Under
    SFAS No. 123R, compensation expenses for share-based
    awards that do not require future service are recorded
    immediately, and share-based awards that require future service
    continue to be amortized into expense over the relevant service
    period. We adopted SFAS No. 123R under the modified
    prospective method whereby the provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R are generally applied only to
    share-based awards granted or modified subsequent to adoption.
    Thus, for Merrill Lynch, SFAS No. 123R required the
    immediate expensing of share-based awards granted or modified in
    2006 to retirement-eligible employees, including awards that are
    subject to non-compete provisions.

 

    Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we had
    recognized expense for share-based compensation over the vesting
    period stipulated in the grant for all employees. This included
    those who had satisfied retirement eligibility criteria but were
    subject to a non-compete agreement that applied from the date of
    retirement through each applicable vesting period. Previously,
    we had accelerated any unrecognized compensation cost for such
    awards if a retirement-eligible employee left Merrill Lynch.
    However, because SFAS No. 123R applies only to awards
    granted or modified in 2006, expenses for share-based awards
    granted prior to 2006 to employees who were retirement-eligible
    with respect to those awards must continue to be amortized over
    the stated vesting period.

    In addition, beginning with performance year 2006, for which we
    granted stock awards in January 2007, we accrued the expense for
    future awards granted to retirement-eligible employees over the
    award performance year instead of recognizing the entire expense
    related to the award on the grant date. Compensation expense for
    the 2006 performance year and subsequent stock awards granted to
    employees not eligible for retirement with respect to those
    awards will be recognized over the applicable vesting period.

 

    SFAS No. 123R also requires expected forfeitures of
    share-based compensation awards for non-retirement-eligible
    employees to be included in determining compensation expense.
    Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, any benefits
    of employee forfeitures of such awards were recorded as a
    reduction of compensation expense when the employee left Merrill
    Lynch and forfeited the award. In the first quarter of 2006, we
    recorded a benefit based on expected forfeitures which was not
    material to the results of operations for the quarter. The
    adoption of SFAS No. 123R resulted in a charge to
    compensation expense of approximately $550 million on a
    pre-tax basis and $370 million on an after-tax basis in the
    first quarter of 2006.

 

    The adoption of SFAS No. 123R, combined with other
    business and competitive considerations, prompted us to
    undertake a comprehensive review of our stock-based incentive
    compensation awards, including vesting schedules and retirement
    eligibility requirements, examining their impact to both Merrill
    Lynch and its employees. Upon the completion of this review, the
    Management Development and Compensation Committee of Merrill
    Lynchs Board of Directors determined that to fulfill the
    objective of retaining high quality personnel, future stock
    grants should contain more stringent retirement provisions.
    These provisions include a combination of increased age and
    length of service requirements. While the stock awards of
    employees who retire continue to vest, retired employees are
    subject to continued compliance with the strict non-compete
    provisions of those awards. To facilitate transition to the more
    stringent future requirements, the terms of most outstanding
    stock awards previously granted to employees, including certain
    executive officers, were modified, effective March 31,
    2006, to permit employees to be immediately eligible for
    retirement with respect to those earlier awards. While we
    modified the retirement-related provisions of the previous stock
    awards, the vesting and non-compete provisions for those awards
    remain in force.

 

    Since the provisions of SFAS No. 123R apply to awards
    modified starting in 2006, these modifications required us to
    record additional one-time compensation expense in the first
    quarter of 2006 for the remaining unamortized amount of all
    awards to employees who had not previously been
    retirement-eligible under the original provisions of those
    awards.

 

    The one-time, non-cash charge associated with the adoption of
    SFAS No. 123R, and the policy modifications to
    previous awards resulted in a net charge to compensation expense
    in the first quarter of 2006 of approximately $1.8 billion
    pre-tax, and $1.2 billion after-tax, or a net impact of
    $1.34 and $1.21 on basic and diluted earnings per share,
    respectively. Policy modifications to previously granted awards
    amounted to $1.2 billion of the pre-tax charge and impacted
    approximately 6,300 employees.

 

    Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we presented
    the cash flows related to income tax deductions in excess of the
    compensation expense recognized on share-based compensation as
    operating cash flows in the Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. SFAS No. 123R requires cash flows resulting
    from tax deductions in excess of the grant-date fair value of
    share-based awards to be included in cash flows from financing
    activities. The excess tax benefits of $283 million related
    to total share-based compensation included in cash flows from
    financing activities in the first quarter of 2006 would have
    been included in cash flows from operating activities if we had
    not adopted SFAS No. 123R.

 

    As a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R, approximately
    $600 million of liabilities associated with the Financial
    Advisor Capital Accumulation Award Plan (FACAAP)
    were reclassified to stockholders equity. In addition, as
    a result of adopting SFAS No. 123R, the unamortized
    portion of employee stock grants, which was previously reported
    as a separate component of stockholders equity on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets, has been reclassified to Paid-in
    capital.

 

    In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the
    Emerging Issues Task Force on Issue
    04-5,
Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General
    Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar
    Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights
    (EITF 04-5).
EITF 04-5
    presumes that a general partner controls a limited partnership,
    and should therefore consolidate a limited partnership, unless
    the limited partners have the substantive ability to remove the
    general partner without cause based on a simple majority vote or
    can otherwise dissolve the limited partnership, or unless the
    limited partners have substantive participating rights over
    decision making. The guidance in
    EITF 04-5
    was effective beginning in the third quarter of 2005 for all new
    limited partnership agreements and any limited partnership
    agreements that were modified. For those partnership agreements
    that existed at the date
    EITF 04-5
    was issued, the guidance became effective in the first quarter
    of 2006. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material
    impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements.

   Note 2. Segment
    and Geographic Information



 










   Segment
    Information
    




    Merrill Lynchs operations are organized into two business
    segments: Global Markets and Investment Banking
    (GMI) and Global Wealth Management
    (GWM). GMI provides full service global markets and
    origination products and services to corporate, institutional,
    and government clients around the world. GWM creates and
    distributes investment products and services for individuals,
    small- to mid-size businesses, and employee benefit plans. Prior
    to the fourth quarter of 2006, Merrill Lynch reported its
    business activities in three business segments: GMI, Global
    Private Client (GPC) and MLIM. Effective with the
    merger of the MLIM business with BlackRock, Inc.
    (BlackRock) in September 2006 (the BlackRock
    Merger), MLIM ceased to exist as a separate business
    segment.

 

    Results for year-end 2006 include one-time compensation expenses
    incurred in the first quarter of 2006, as follows:
    $1.4 billion in GMI, $281 million in GWM and
    $109 million in MLIM; refer to Note 1, New Accounting
    Pronouncements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    further information on one-time compensation expenses.

 

    The principal methodologies used in preparing the segment
    results in the table that follows are:

 






     

    Revenues and expenses are assigned to segments where directly
    attributable;


 

     

    Principal transactions, net interest and investment banking
    revenues and related costs resulting from the client activities
    of GWM are allocated among GMI and GWM based on production
    credits, share counts, trade counts, and other measures which
    estimate relative value;


 

     

    Through the third quarter of 2006, MLIM received a net advisory
    fee from GWM relating to certain MLIM-branded products offered
    through GWMs 401(k) product offering;


 

     

    Through the third quarter of 2006, revenues and expenses related
    to mutual fund shares bearing a contingent deferred sales charge
    were reflected in segment results as if MLIM and GWM were
    unrelated entities;


 

     

    Interest (cost of carry) is allocated by charging each segment
    based on its capital usage and Merrill Lynchs blended cost
    of capital;


 

     

    Acquisition financing costs and other corporate interest are
    included in the Corporate items because management excludes
    these items from segment operating results in evaluating segment
    performance;


 

     

    Merrill Lynch has revenue and expense sharing agreements for
    joint activities between segments, and the results of each
    segment reflect the
    agreed-upon
    apportionment of revenues and expenses associated with these
    activities; and


 

     

    Residual expenses (i.e., those related to overhead and support
    units) are attributed to segments based on specific
    methodologies (e.g., headcount, square footage, intersegment
    agreements).

   Note 3. Fair
    Value and Trading Risk Management




    Merrill Lynch adopted the provisions of SFAS No.157 and
    SFAS No.159 in the first quarter of 2007.

 










   Fair
    Value Measurements
    




    SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value
    hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair
    value, and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value
    measurements. Merrill Lynch accounts for a significant portion
    of its financial instruments at fair value or considers fair
    value in their measurement. Merrill Lynch accounts for certain
    financial assets and liabilities at fair value under various
    accounting literature, including SFAS No. 115,
    SFAS No. 133 and SFAS No. 159. Merrill Lynch
    also accounts for certain assets at fair value under applicable
    industry guidance, namely broker-dealer and investment company
    accounting guidance.

 

Fair Value
    Hierarchy


    In accordance with SFAS No. 157, Merrill Lynch has
    categorized its financial instruments, based on the priority of
    the inputs to the valuation technique, into a three-level fair
    value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest
    priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
    or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to
    unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to
    measure the financial instruments fall within different levels
    of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest
    level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of
    the instrument.

 

    Financial assets and liabilities recorded on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets are categorized based on the inputs to the
    valuation techniques as follows:

 

Level 1. Financial assets and liabilities whose
    values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in an active market that Merrill Lynch has
    the ability to access (examples include active exchange-traded
    equity securities, exchange-traded derivatives, most
    U.S. Government and agency securities, and certain other
    sovereign government obligations).

 

Level 2. Financial assets and liabilities whose
    values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active
    or model inputs that are observable either directly or
    indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or
    liability. Level 2 inputs include the following:

 







 
    a) 


    Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
    markets (for example, restricted stock);







  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report


 


    page 104


 


 









Table of Contents








 
    b) 


    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in
    non-active markets (examples include corporate and municipal
    bonds, which trade infrequently);


 

 
    c) 


    Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the
    full term of the asset or liability (examples include most
    over-the-counter derivatives, including interest rate and
    currency swaps); and


 

 
    d) 


    Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or
    corroborated by observable market data through correlation
    or other means for substantially the full term of the asset or
    liability (examples include certain residential
    and commercial mortgage-related assets, including loans,
    securities and derivatives).



 

Level 3. Financial assets and liabilities whose
    values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require
    inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall
    fair value measurement. These inputs reflect managements
    own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would
    use in pricing the asset or liability (examples include certain
    private equity investments, certain residential and commercial
    mortgage-related assets (including loans, securities and
    derivatives), and long-dated or complex derivatives including
    certain equity derivatives and long-dated options on gas and
    power).

 

    As required by SFAS No. 157, when the inputs used to
    measure fair value fall within different levels of the
    hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is
    categorized is based on the lowest level input that is
    significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For
    example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include
    inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and
    unobservable (Level 3). Therefore gains and losses for such
    assets and liabilities categorized within the Level 3 table
    below may include changes in fair value that are attributable to
    both observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and
    unobservable inputs (Level 3). Further, it should be noted
    that the following tables do not take into consideration the
    effect of offsetting Level 1 and 2 financial instruments
    entered into by Merrill Lynch that economically hedge certain
    exposures to the Level 3 positions.

 

    A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on
    a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation
    inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial
    assets or liabilities. Reclassifications impacting Level 3
    of the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers in/out of
    the Level 3 category as of the beginning of the quarter in
    which the reclassifications occur. During the third quarter of
    2007, a significant amount of assets and liabilities were
    reclassified from Level 2 to Level 3. This
    reclassification primarily relates to sub-prime mortgage related
    assets and liabilities, including CDOs, because of the
    significant decrease in the observability of market pricing for
    these instruments. Refer to credit concentrations in the Trading
    Risk Management section of this note for further information
    about exposures to these instruments.

Level 3
    Assets and Liabilities


    Level 3 trading assets primarily include corporate bonds
    and loans of $5.4 billion and U.S. ABS CDOs of
    $2.4 billion, of which $1.0 billion was sub-prime
    related.

    which $14.7 billion is sub-prime related, and
    $5.1 billion of equity derivatives that are long-dated
    and/or have unobservable correlation.

 

    Level 3 investment securities primarily relate to certain
    private equity and principal investment positions of
    $4.0 billion, as well as U.S. ABS CDOs of
    $834 million that are accounted for as trading securities
    under SFAS No. 115.

 

    Level 3 derivative contracts (liabilities) primarily relate
    to derivative positions on U.S. ABS CDOs of
    $25.1 billion, of which $23.9 billion relates to
    sub-prime, and $8.3 billion of equity derivatives that are
    long-dated and/or have unobservable correlation.

    Net losses in principal transactions were due primarily to
    $16.7 billion of write-downs related to U.S. ABS CDOs
    and other sub-prime related instruments that are classified as
    Level 3, partially offset by $1.4 billion in gains on
    non-subprime mortgage-related items and net gains in
    equity-related products.

 

    The increases attributable to purchases, issuances, and
    settlements on Level 3 assets and liabilities included the
    exercise of certain purchase obligations in the third quarter of
    2007 that required Merrill Lynch to buy underlying assets,
    primarily U.S. ABS CDOs. In addition, Level 3 assets
    and liabilities increased due to the consolidation of an SPE
    which also primarily contained U.S. ABS CDOs.

 

    The increases attributable to net transfers in on Level 3
    assets and liabilities were due primarily to the decrease in
    observability of market pricing for instruments which had
    previously been classified as Level 2. These were primarily
    U.S. ABS CDOs and related instruments of $6.8 billion
    and corporate bonds and loans that are classified as trading
    assets of $3.9 billion, offset by $2.7 billion of net
    transfers out of equity derivatives.

 

    The following table provides the portion of gains or losses
    included in income for the year-ended December 28, 2007
    attributable to unrealized gains or losses relating to those
    Level 3 assets and liabilities still held at
    December 28, 2007.

    Total net unrealized losses were primarily due to
    $16.7 billion of write-downs related to U.S. ABS CDOs
    and other sub-prime related instruments that are classified as
    Level 3, partially offset by $1.4 billion in gains on
    non-subprime mortgage-related items and net gains in
    equity-related products.

 

    Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a
    non-recurring basis and are not included in the tables above.
    These assets and liabilities include loans and loan commitments
    held for sale and reported at lower-of-cost-or-market and loans
    held for investment that were initially measured at cost and
    have been written down to fair value as a result of an
    impairment. The following table shows the fair value hierarchy
    for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a

    Loans, notes, and mortgages include held for sale loans that are
    carried at the lower of cost or market and for which the fair
    value was below the cost basis at December 28, 2007. It
    also includes certain impaired held for investment loans where
    an allowance for loan losses has been calculated based upon the
    fair value of the loans. Level 3 assets primarily relate to
    residential and commercial real estate loans that are classified
    as held for sale of $4.1 billion in the United Kingdom
    where there continues to be significant illiquidity in the
    securitization market. The losses on the Level 3 loans were
    calculated primarily by a fundamental cash flow valuation
    analysis. This cash flow analysis includes cumulative loss
    assumptions derived from multiple inputs including mortgage
    remittance reports, housing prices and other market data.

 

    Other liabilities include amounts recorded for loan commitments
    at lower of cost or fair value where the funded loan will be
    held for sale, particularly leveraged loan commitments in the
    U.S. The losses were calculated by models incorporating
    significant observable market data.

 










   Fair
    Value Option
    




    SFAS No. 159 provides a fair value option election
    that allows companies to irrevocably elect fair value as the
    initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain
    financial assets and liabilities. Changes in fair value for
    assets and liabilities for which the election is made will be
    recognized in earnings as they occur. SFAS No. 159
    permits the fair value option election on an instrument by
    instrument basis at initial recognition of an asset or liability
    or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting
    for that instrument. As discussed above, certain of Merrill
    Lynchs financial instruments are required to be accounted
    for at fair value under SFAS No. 115 and
    SFAS No. 133 as well as industry level guidance. For
    certain financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair
    value under other applicable accounting guidance, the fair value
    option has been elected.

 

    The following table presents a summary of eligible financial
    assets and financial liabilities for which the fair value option
    was elected on December 30, 2006 and the cumulative-effect
    adjustment to retained earnings recorded in connection with the
    initial adoption of SFAS No. 159.

    The following describes the rationale for electing to account
    for certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, as
    well as the impact of instrument-specific credit risk on the
    fair value.

 

Resale and
    Repurchase Agreements:


    Merrill Lynch elected the fair value option on a prospective
    basis for certain resale and repurchase agreements. The fair
    value option election was made based on the tenor of the resale
    and repurchase agreements, which reflects the magnitude of the
    interest rate risk. The majority of resale and repurchase
    agreements collateralized by U.S. and Japanese government
    securities were excluded from the fair value option election as
    these contracts are generally short-dated and therefore the
    interest rate risk is not considered significant. Amounts loaned
    under resale agreements require collateral with a market value
    equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned resulting
    in immaterial credit risk for such transactions.

 

Investment
    Securities:


    Merrill Lynch elected the fair value option for certain fixed
    rate securities in its treasury liquidity portfolio previously
    classified as available-for-sale securities as management
    modified its investment strategy and economic exposure to
    interest rate risk by eliminating long-term fixed rate assets in
    its liquidity portfolio and replacing them with floating rate
    assets. These securities were carried at fair value in
    accordance with SFAS No. 115 prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 159. An unrealized loss of $172 million,
    net of tax, related to such securities was reclassified from
    accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings.

 

    At December 28, 2007 investment securities primarily
    represented non-marketable convertible preferred shares for
    which Merrill Lynch has economically hedged a majority of the
    position with derivatives.

 

Loans, Notes, and
    Mortgages:


    Merrill Lynch elected the fair value option for automobile and
    certain corporate loans because the loans are risk managed on a
    fair value basis. The change in the fair value of loans, notes,
    and mortgages for which the fair value option was elected that
    was attributable to changes in borrower-specific credit risk was
    not material for the year-ended December 28, 2007.

 

    For those loans, notes and mortgages for which the fair value
    option has been elected, the aggregate fair value of loans that
    are 90 days or more past due and in non-accrual status are
    not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

Long-Term
    Borrowings:


    Merrill Lynch elected the fair value option for certain
    long-term borrowings that are risk managed on a fair value
    basis, including structured notes, and for which hedge
    accounting under SFAS No. 133 had been difficult to
    obtain. The changes in the fair value of liabilities for which
    the fair value option was elected that was attributable to
    changes in Merrill Lynch credit spreads were estimated gains of
    $2.0 billion for the year-ended December 28, 2007.
    Changes in Merrill Lynch specific credit risk is derived by
    isolating fair value changes due to changes in Merrill
    Lynchs credit spreads as observed in the secondary cash
    market.

 

    The fair value option was also elected for certain non-recourse
    long-term borrowings issued by consolidated SPEs. The fair value
    of these long-term borrowings is unaffected by changes in
    Merrill Lynchs creditworthiness.

   Hybrid
    Financial Instruments
    




    In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155, which
    clarifies the bifurcation requirements for certain financial
    instruments and permits hybrid financial instruments that
    contain a bifurcatable embedded derivative to be accounted for
    as a single financial instrument at fair value with changes in
    fair value recognized in earnings. This election is permitted on
    an
    instrument-by-instrument
    basis for all hybrid financial instruments held, obtained, or
    issued as of the adoption date. At adoption, any difference
    between the total carrying amount of the individual components
    of the existing bifurcated hybrid financial instruments and the
    fair value of the combined hybrid financial instruments is
    recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning
    retained earnings. Merrill Lynch adopted SFAS No. 155
    on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of 2007.
    Since SFAS No. 159 incorporates accounting and
    disclosure requirements that are similar to
    SFAS No. 155, Merrill Lynch applies
    SFAS No. 159, rather than SFAS No. 155, to
    its fair value elections for hybrid financial instruments, which
    are primarily structured notes classified as long-term
    borrowings.

 










   Trading
    Risk Management
    




    Trading activities subject Merrill Lynch to market and credit
    risks. These risks are managed in accordance with established
    risk management policies and procedures. Specifically, the
    independent risk and control groups work to ensure that these
    risks are properly identified, measured, monitored, and managed
    throughout Merrill Lynch. To accomplish this, Merrill Lynch has
    established a risk management process that includes:

 






     

    A risk governance structure that defines the oversight process
    and its components;


 

     

    A regular review of the risk management process by the Audit
    Committee of the Board of Directors as well as a regular review
    of credit, market and liquidity risks and processes by the
    Finance Committee of the Board of Directors;


 

     

    Clearly defined risk management policies and procedures
    supported by a rigorous analytical framework;


 

     

    Communication and coordination among the businesses, executive
    management, and risk functions while maintaining strict
    segregation of responsibilities, controls, and
    oversight; and


 

     

    Clearly articulated risk tolerance levels, defined and regularly
    reviewed by Global Risk Management and reviewed by senior
    management, that are consistent with its business strategy,
    capital structure, and current and anticipated market conditions.



 

    Independent risk and control groups interact with the businesses
    to establish and maintain this overall risk management control
    process. While no risk management system can ever be absolutely
    complete, the goal of these independent risk and control groups
    is to mitigate risk-related losses so that they fall within
    acceptable, predefined levels, under foreseeable scenarios.

 

Market
    Risk


    Market risk is the potential change in an instruments
    value caused by fluctuations in interest and currency exchange
    rates, equity and commodity prices, credit spreads, or other
    risks. The level of market risk is influenced by the volatility
    and the liquidity in the markets in which financial instruments
    are traded.

 

    Merrill Lynch seeks to mitigate market risk associated with
    trading inventories by employing hedging strategies that
    correlate rate, price, and spread movements of trading
    inventories and related financing and hedging activities.
    Merrill Lynch uses a combination of cash instruments and
    derivatives to hedge its market exposures. The following
    discussion describes the types of market risk faced by Merrill
    Lynch.

 

Interest Rate
    Risk


    Interest rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in
    interest rates will affect the value of financial instruments.
    Interest rate swap agreements, Eurodollar futures, and
    U.S. Treasury securities and futures are common interest
    rate risk management tools. The





  
  
  
  
  




 


 


    page 109


 












Table of Contents


    decision to manage interest rate risk using futures or swap
    contracts, as opposed to buying or selling short
    U.S. Treasury or other securities, depends on current
    market conditions and funding considerations.

 

    Interest rate agreements used by Merrill Lynch include caps,
    collars, floors, basis swaps, leveraged swaps, and options.
    Interest rate caps and floors provide the purchaser with
    protection against rising and falling interest rates,
    respectively. Interest rate collars combine a cap and a floor,
    providing the purchaser with a predetermined interest rate
    range. Basis swaps are a type of interest rate swap agreement
    where variable rates are received and paid, but are based on
    different index rates. Leveraged swaps are another type of
    interest rate swap where changes in the variable rate are
    multiplied by a contractual leverage factor, such as four times
    three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).
    Merrill Lynchs exposure to interest rate risk resulting
    from these leverage factors is typically hedged with other
    financial instruments.

 

Currency
    Risk


    Currency risk arises from the possibility that fluctuations in
    foreign exchange rates will impact the value of financial
    instruments. Merrill Lynchs trading assets and liabilities
    include both cash instruments denominated in and derivatives
    linked to more than 50 currencies, including the euro, Japanese
    yen, British pound, and Swiss franc. Currency forwards and
    options are commonly used to manage currency risk associated
    with these instruments. Currency swaps may also be used in
    situations where a long-dated forward market is not available or
    where the client needs a customized instrument to hedge a
    foreign currency cash flow stream. Typically, parties to a
    currency swap initially exchange principal amounts in two
    currencies, agreeing to exchange interest payments and to
    re-exchange the currencies at a future date and exchange rate.

 

Equity Price
    Risk


    Equity price risk arises from the possibility that equity
    security prices will fluctuate, affecting the value of equity
    securities and other instruments that derive their value from a
    particular stock, a defined basket of stocks, or a stock index.
    Instruments typically used by Merrill Lynch to manage equity
    price risk include equity options, warrants, and baskets of
    equity securities. Equity options, for example, can require the
    writer to purchase or sell a specified stock or to make a cash
    payment based on changes in the market price of that stock,
    basket of stocks, or stock index.

 

Credit Spread
    Risk


    Credit spread risk arises from the possibility that changes in
    credit spreads will affect the value of financial instruments.
    Credit spreads represent the credit risk premiums required by
    market participants for a given credit quality (i.e., the
    additional yield that a debt instrument issued by a AA-rated
    entity must produce over a risk-free alternative (e.g.,
    U.S. Treasury instrument)). Certain instruments are used by
    Merrill Lynch to manage this type of risk. Swaps and options,
    for example, can be designed to mitigate losses due to changes
    in credit spreads, as well as the credit downgrade or default of
    the issuer. Credit risk resulting from default on counterparty
    obligations is discussed in the Counterparty Credit Risk section.

 

Commodity Price
    and Other Risks


    Through its commodities business, Merrill Lynch enters into
    exchange-traded contracts, financially settled OTC derivatives,
    contracts for physical delivery and contracts providing for the
    transportation, transmission
    and/or
    storage rights on or in vessels, barges, pipelines, transmission
    lines or storage facilities. Commodity, related storage,
    transportation or other contracts expose Merrill Lynch to the
    risk that the price of the underlying commodity or the cost of
    storing or transporting commodities may rise or fall. In
    addition, contracts relating to physical ownership
    and/or
    delivery can expose Merrill Lynch to numerous other risks,
    including performance and environmental risks.

 

Counterparty
    Credit Risk


    Merrill Lynch is exposed to risk of loss if an individual,
    counterparty or issuer fails to perform its obligations under
    contractual terms (default risk). Both cash
    instruments and derivatives expose Merrill Lynch to default
    risk. Credit risk arising from changes in credit spreads was
    previously discussed in the Market Risk section.

 

    Merrill Lynch has established policies and procedures for
    mitigating credit risk on principal transactions, including
    reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure,
    maintaining qualifying collateral, purchasing credit protection,
    and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties.

 

    In the normal course of business, Merrill Lynch executes,
    settles, and finances various customer securities transactions.
    Execution of these transactions includes the purchase and sale
    of securities by Merrill Lynch. These activities may expose
    Merrill Lynch to default risk arising from the potential that
    customers or counterparties may fail to satisfy their
    obligations. In these situations, Merrill Lynch may be required
    to purchase or sell financial instruments at unfavorable market
    prices to satisfy obligations to other customers or
    counterparties. Additional information about these obligations
    is provided in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements. In addition, Merrill Lynch seeks to control the
    risks associated with its customer margin activities by
    requiring customers to maintain collateral in compliance with
    regulatory and internal guidelines.





  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report


 


    page 110


 


 









Table of Contents


    Liabilities to other brokers and dealers related to unsettled
    transactions (i.e., securities failed-to-receive) are recorded
    at the amount for which the securities were purchased, and are
    paid upon receipt of the securities from other brokers or
    dealers. In the case of aged securities failed-to-receive,
    Merrill Lynch may purchase the underlying security in the market
    and seek reimbursement for losses from the counterparty.

 

Concentrations of
    Credit Risk


    Merrill Lynchs exposure to credit risk (both default and
    credit spread) associated with its trading and other activities
    is measured on an individual counterparty basis, as well as by
    groups of counterparties that share similar attributes.
    Concentrations of credit risk can be affected by changes in
    political, industry, or economic factors. To reduce the
    potential for risk concentration, credit limits are established
    and monitored in light of changing counterparty and market
    conditions.

 

    At December 28, 2007, Merrill Lynchs most significant
    concentration of credit risk was with the U.S. Government
    and its agencies. This concentration consists of both direct and
    indirect exposures. Direct exposure, which primarily results
    from trading asset and investment security positions in
    instruments issued by the U.S. Government and its agencies,
    excluding mortgage-backed securities, amounted to
    $11.1 billion and $15.0 billion at December 28,
    2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively. Merrill
    Lynchs indirect exposure results from maintaining
    U.S. Government and agencies securities as collateral for
    resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions. Merrill
    Lynchs direct credit exposure on these transactions is
    with the counterparty; thus Merrill Lynch has credit exposure to
    the U.S. Government and its agencies only in the event of
    the counterpartys default. Securities issued by the
    U.S. Government or its agencies held as collateral for
    resale agreements and securities borrowed transactions at
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006 totaled
    $105.2 billion and $116.3 billion, respectively.

 

    At December 28, 2007, Merrill Lynch had other
    concentrations of credit risk, the largest of which was related
    to a foreign bank carrying an internal credit rating of AA,
    reflecting diversification across products, sound capital
    adequacy and flexibility. Total outstanding unsecured exposure
    to this counterparty was approximately $4.5 billion, or
    0.45% of total assets.

 

    Merrill Lynchs most significant industry credit
    concentration is with financial institutions. Financial
    institutions include banks, insurance companies, finance
    companies, investment managers, and other diversified financial
    institutions. This concentration arises in the normal course of
    Merrill Lynchs brokerage, trading, hedging, financing, and
    underwriting activities. Merrill Lynch also monitors credit
    exposures worldwide by region. Outside the United States,
    financial institutions and sovereign governments represent the
    most significant concentrations of credit risk.

 

    In the normal course of business, Merrill Lynch purchases,
    sells, underwrites, and makes markets in non-investment grade
    instruments. Merrill Lynch also provides extensions of credit
    and makes equity investments to facilitate leveraged
    transactions. These activities expose Merrill Lynch to a higher
    degree of credit risk than is associated with trading, investing
    in, and underwriting investment grade instruments and extending
    credit to investment grade counterparties.

 

Concentration of
    Risk to the U.S. Sub-Prime Residential Mortgage
    Market


    At December 28, 2007, Merrill Lynch had sizeable exposure
    to U.S. sub-prime residential mortgages through securities,
    derivatives, loans and loan commitments. This included:

 






     

    Net exposure of $2.7 billion in U.S. sub-prime
    residential mortgage-related positions, excluding Merrill
    Lynchs U.S. banks investment security portfolio;


 

     

    Net exposure of $4.8 billion in super senior U.S. ABS
    CDOs and secondary trading exposures related to the ABS CDO
    business; and


 

     

    Net exposure of $4.2 billion in sub-prime residential
    mortgage-backed securities and U.S. ABS CDOs held in
    Merrill Lynchs U.S. banks investment portfolio.



 

    Valuation of these exposures will continue to be impacted by
    external market factors including default rates, rating agency
    actions, and the prices at which observable market transactions
    occur. Merrill Lynchs ability to mitigate its risk by
    selling or hedging its exposures is also limited by the market
    environment. Merrill Lynchs future results may continue to
    be materially impacted by the valuation adjustments applied to
    these positions.

 

Concentration of
    Risk to Financial Guarantors


    To economically hedge certain ABS CDO and U.S. sub-prime
    mortgage positions, Merrill Lynch entered into credit
    derivatives with various counterparties, including financial
    guarantors. At December 28, 2007, Merrill Lynchs
    short exposure from credit default swaps with financial
    guarantors to economically hedge certain U.S. super senior ABS
    CDOs was $13.8 billion, which represented credit default
    swaps with a notional amount of $19.9 billion that have
    been adjusted for mark-to-market gains of $6.1 billion. The
    fair value of these credit default swaps at December 28,
    2007 was $3.5 billion, after taking into account a
    $2.6 billion credit valuation adjustment related to certain
    financial guarantors.





  
  
  
  
  




 


 


    page 111


 












Table of Contents


    Merrill Lynch also has credit derivatives with financial
    guarantors on other referenced assets. The mark-to-market gains
    on these credit derivatives at December 28, 2007 were
    $2.0 billion, after taking into account a $0.5 billion
    credit valuation adjustment.

 

Derivatives


    Merrill Lynchs trading derivatives consist of derivatives
    provided to customers and derivatives entered into for
    proprietary trading strategies or risk management purposes.

 

    Default risk exposure varies by type of derivative. Default risk
    on derivatives can occur for the full notional amount of the
    trade where a final exchange of principal takes place, as may be
    the case for currency swaps. Swap agreements and forward
    contracts are generally OTC-transacted and thus are exposed to
    default risk to the extent of their replacement cost. Since
    futures contracts are exchange-traded and usually require daily
    cash settlement, the related risk of loss is generally limited
    to a one-day
    net positive change in market value. Generally such receivables
    and payables are recorded in customers receivables and
    payables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Option contracts
    can be exchange-traded or OTC. Purchased options have default
    risk to the extent of their replacement cost. Written options
    represent a potential obligation to counterparties and typically
    do not subject Merrill Lynch to default risk except under
    circumstances where the option premium is being financed or in
    cases where Merrill Lynch is required to post collateral.
    Additional information about derivatives that meet the
    definition of a guarantee for accounting purposes is included in
    Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    Merrill Lynch generally enters into ISDA master agreements or
    their equivalent with substantially all of its counterparties,
    as soon as possible. Master netting agreements provide
    protection in bankruptcy in certain circumstances and, in some
    cases, enable receivables and payables with the same
    counterparty to be offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
    providing for a more meaningful balance sheet presentation of
    credit exposure. Agreements are negotiated bilaterally and can
    require complex terms. While reasonable efforts are made to
    execute such agreements, it is possible that a counterparty may
    be unwilling to sign such an agreement and, as a result, would
    subject Merrill Lynch to additional credit risk. The
    enforceability of master netting agreements under bankruptcy
    laws in certain countries or in certain industries is not free
    from doubt and receivables and payables with counterparties in
    these countries or industries are accordingly recorded on a
    gross basis.

 

    To reduce the risk of loss, Merrill Lynch requires collateral,
    principally cash and U.S. Government and agency securities,
    on certain derivative transactions. Merrill Lynch nets cash
    collateral paid or received under credit support annexes
    associated with legally enforceable master netting agreements
    against derivative inventory. At December 28, 2007, cash
    collateral netted against derivative inventory was
    $13.5 billion. From an economic standpoint, Merrill Lynch
    evaluates default risk exposures net of related collateral. In
    addition to obtaining collateral, Merrill Lynch attempts to
    mitigate default risk on derivatives by entering into
    transactions with provisions that enable Merrill Lynch to
    terminate or reset the terms of the derivative contract.

 

    Many of Merrill Lynchs derivative contracts contain
    provisions that could, upon an adverse change in ML &
    Co.s credit rating, trigger a requirement for an early
    payment or additional collateral support.

 










   Note 4. Securities
    Financing Transactions




    Merrill Lynch enters into secured borrowing and lending
    transactions in order to meet customers needs and earn
    residual interest rate spreads, obtain securities for settlement
    and finance trading inventory positions.

 

    Under these transactions, Merrill Lynch either receives or
    provides collateral, including U.S. Government and
    agencies, asset-backed, corporate debt, equity, and
    non-U.S. governments
    and agencies securities. Merrill Lynch receives collateral in
    connection with resale agreements, securities borrowed
    transactions, customer margin loans, and other loans. Under many
    agreements, Merrill Lynch is permitted to sell or repledge the
    securities received (e.g., use the securities to secure
    repurchase agreements, enter into securities lending
    transactions, or deliver to counterparties to cover short
    positions). At December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, the
    fair value of securities received as collateral where Merrill
    Lynch is permitted to sell or repledge the securities was
    $855 billion and $633 billion, respectively, and the
    fair value of the portion that has been sold or repledged was
    $654 billion and $498 billion, respectively. Merrill
    Lynch may use securities received as collateral for resale
    agreements to satisfy regulatory requirements such as
    Rule 15c3-3
    of the SEC. The fair value of collateral used for this purpose
    was $19.3 billion at December 28, 2007 and
    December 29, 2006.

 

    Merrill Lynch additionally receives securities as collateral in
    connection with certain securities for securities transactions
    in which Merrill Lynch is the lender. In instances where Merrill
    Lynch is permitted to sell or repledge securities received,
    Merrill Lynch reports the fair value of such securities received
    as collateral and the related obligation to return securities
    received as collateral in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

   Note 5. Investment
    Securities




    Investment securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include:

 






     

    SFAS No. 115 investments held by ML & Co.
    and certain of its non-broker-dealer entities, including Merrill
    Lynch banks. SFAS No. 115 investments consist of:



 







 
     


    Debt securities, including debt held for investment and
    liquidity and collateral management purposes that are classified
    as available-for-sale, debt securities held for trading
    purposes, and debt securities that Merrill Lynch intends to hold
    until maturity;


 

 
     


    Marketable equity securities, which are generally classified as
    available-for-sale.



 






     

    Non-qualifying investments are those that do not fall within the
    scope of SFAS No. 115. Non-qualifying investments
    consist principally of:



 







 
     


    Equity investments, including investments in partnerships and
    joint ventures. Included in equity investments are investments
    accounted for under the equity method of accounting, which
    consist of investments in (i) partnerships and certain
    limited liability corporations where Merrill Lynch has more than
    minor influence (i.e. generally defined as greater than a three
    percent interest) and (ii) corporate entities where Merrill
    Lynch has the ability to exercise significant influence over the
    investee (i.e. generally defined as ownership and voting
    interest of 20% to 50%). Also included in equity investments are
    private equity investments that Merrill Lynch holds for capital
    appreciation
    and/or
    current income and which are accounted for at fair value in
    accordance with the Investment Company Guide, as well as private
    equity investments accounted for at fair value under the fair
    value option election in SFAS No. 159. The carrying value
    of private equity investments reflects expected exit values
    based upon market prices or other valuation methodologies
    including discounted expected cash flows and market comparables
    of similar companies.


 

 
     


    Investments of insurance subsidiaries for year-end 2006, which
    primarily represent insurance policy loans and are accounted for
    at amortized cost.


 

 
     


    Deferred compensation hedges, which are investments economically
    hedging deferred compensation liabilities and are accounted for
    at fair value.



 

    Fair value for non-qualifying investments is estimated using a
    number of methods, including earnings multiples, discounted cash
    flow analyses, and review of underlying financial conditions and
    other market factors. These instruments may be subject to
    restrictions (e.g., sale requires consent of other investors to
    sell) that may limit Merrill Lynchs ability to currently
    realize the estimated fair value. Accordingly, Merrill
    Lynchs current estimate of fair value and the ultimate
    realization for these instruments may differ.

Includes investments in
    Non-U.S.
    Government and agency securities.
    


 

    The majority of the unrealized losses relate to mortgage- and
    asset-backed securities issued by U.S. agencies.

 

    Merrill Lynch reviews its held-to-maturity and
    available-for-sale securities at least quarterly to assess
    whether any impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors
    considered in the review include estimated future cash flows,
    length of time and extent to which market value has been less
    than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of
    the issuer, and Merrill Lynchs intent and ability to
    retain the security to allow for an anticipated recovery in
    market value. Merrill Lynchs impairment review generally
    includes:

 






     

    Identifying investments with indicators of possible impairment;


 

     

    Analyzing individual investments with fair values less than
    amortized cost, including estimating future cash flows, and
    considering the length of time and extent to which the
    investment has been in an unrealized loss position;


 

     

    Discussion of evidential matter, including an evaluation of
    factors or triggers that could cause individual investments to
    qualify as having other-than-temporary impairment; and


 

     

    Documenting the analysis and conclusions.



 

    As of December 28, 2007, Merrill Lynch determined that
    certain available-for-sale securities primarily related to
    U.S. ABS CDO securities were other-than-temporarily
    impaired and recognized a loss of approximately
    $900 million for the year-ended December 28, 2007.

 

    The amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities
    at December 28, 2007 by contractual maturity, for
    available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investments follow:

Carrying amount consists of a 45%
    voting common equity interest and a 5% preferred equity interest.
    



(2)
    


Carrying amount at
    December 28, 2007 is zero as a result of dividends received
    in excess of cumulative equity method earnings and Merrill
    Lynchs initial investment.
    



(3)
    


Investment in a private equity fund.
    



(4)
    


Investment in an alternative
    investment fund. Merrill Lynch does not consolidate this
    investment as its ownership percentage represents a non-voting
    interest.
    


 

    In connection with the BlackRock merger on September 29,
    2006 (see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for further information on the BlackRock merger), Merrill Lynch
    received an equity interest in BlackRock. As of
    December 28, 2007, the aggregate market value of Merrill
    Lynchs common equity interest in BlackRock was
    $11.5 billion, based on the closing stock price on the New
    York Stock Exchange. This market value does not reflect Merrill
    Lynchs preferred equity interest in BlackRock. The
    carrying amount of Merrill Lynchs investment in BlackRock
    at December 28, 2007 was $4.7 billion more than the
    underlying equity in net assets due to equity method goodwill,
    indefinite-lived intangible assets and definite-lived intangible
    assets, of which Merrill Lynch amortized $48 million and
    $10 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Such
    amortization is reflected in earnings from equity method
    investments in the Consolidated Statements of (Loss)/Earnings.

 


 

    Summarized aggregate financial information for Merrill
    Lynchs most significant equity method investees (BlackRock
    Inc., Bloomberg L.P., Warburg Pincus Fund IX, L.P. and WCG
    Master Fund Ltd.), which represents 100% of the
    investees financial information for the periods in which
    Merrill Lynch held the investments is as follows:

   Securitizations
    




    In the normal course of business, Merrill Lynch securitizes
    commercial and residential mortgage loans, municipal,
    government, and corporate bonds, and other types of financial
    assets. SPEs, often referred to as Variable Interest Entities
    (VIEs) are often used when entering into or facilitating
    securitization transactions. Merrill Lynchs involvement
    with SPEs used to securitize financial assets includes:
    structuring
    and/or
    establishing SPEs; selling assets to SPEs; managing or servicing
    assets held by SPEs; underwriting, distributing, and making
    loans to SPEs; making markets in securities issued by SPEs;
    engaging in derivative transactions with SPEs; owning notes or
    certificates issued by SPEs;
    and/or
    providing liquidity facilities and other guarantees to, or for
    the benefit of, SPEs.

 

    Merrill Lynch securitized assets of approximately
    $173.1 billion and $147.5 billion for the years ended
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively.
    For the years ended December 28, 2007 and December 29,
    2006, Merrill Lynch received $175.9 billion and
    $148.8 billion, respectively, of proceeds, and other cash
    inflows, from securitization transactions, and recognized net
    securitization gains of $154.6 million and
    $333.2 million, respectively, in Merrill Lynchs
    Consolidated Statements of (Loss)/Earnings.

 

    The table below summarizes the cash inflows received by Merrill
    Lynch from securitization transactions related to the following
    underlying asset types:

    In certain instances, Merrill Lynch retains interests in the
    senior tranche, subordinated tranche,
    and/or
    residual tranche of securities issued by certain SPEs created to
    securitize assets. The gain or loss on the sale of the assets is
    determined with reference to the previous carrying amount of the
    financial assets transferred, which is allocated between the
    assets sold and the retained interests, if any, based on their
    relative fair value at the date of transfer.

 

    Retained interests are recorded in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets at fair value. To obtain fair values, observable market
    prices are used if available. Where observable market prices are
    unavailable, Merrill Lynch generally estimates fair value
    initially and on an ongoing basis based on the present value of
    expected future cash flows using managements best
    estimates of credit losses, prepayment rates, forward yield
    curves, and discount rates, commensurate with the risks
    involved. Retained interests are either held as trading assets,
    with changes in fair value recorded in the Consolidated
    Statements of (Loss)/Earnings, or as securities
    available-for-sale, with changes in fair value included in
    accumulated other comprehensive loss. Retained interests held as
    available-for-sale are reviewed periodically for impairment.

 

    Retained interests in securitized assets were approximately
    $6.1 billion and $6.8 billion at December 28,
    2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively, which related
    primarily to residential mortgage loan, municipal bond, and
    commercial and corporate loan and bond securitization
    transactions. As a result of the illiquidity in the
    mortgage-backed securities market at the end of 2007, the
    majority of the mortgage-backed securities retained interest
    balance had limited price transparency at December 28,
    2007. As of December 29, 2006, the majority of retained
    interest balance of mortgage-backed securities had observable
    market prices. The majority of these retained interests include
    mortgage-backed securities that Merrill Lynch had expected to
    sell to investors in the normal course of its underwriting
    activity. However, the timing of any sale is subject to current
    and future market conditions. A portion of the retained
    interests represent residual interests in U.S. sub-prime
    mortgage securitizations and is included in the Level 3
    U.S. ABS CDO exposure disclosed in Note 3 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

    The preceding sensitivity analysis is hypothetical and should be
    used with caution. In particular, the effect of a variation in a
    particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest
    is calculated independent of changes in any other assumption; in
    practice, changes in one factor may result in changes in
    another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
    Further, changes in fair value based on a 10% or 20% variation
    in an assumption or parameter generally cannot be extrapolated
    because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the
    change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the sensitivity
    analysis does not include the offsetting benefit of financial
    instruments that Merrill Lynch utilizes to hedge risks,
    including credit, interest rate, and prepayment risk, that are
    inherent in the retained interests. These hedging strategies are
    structured to take into consideration the hypothetical stress
    scenarios above such that they would be effective in principally
    offsetting Merrill Lynchs exposure to loss in the event
    these scenarios occur.

 

    The weighted average assumptions and parameters used initially
    to value retained interests relating to securitizations that
    were still held by Merrill Lynch as of December 28, 2007
    are as follows:

    For residential mortgage loan and other securitizations, the
    investors and the securitization trust generally have no
    recourse to Merrill Lynch upon the event of a borrower default.
    See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for
    information related to representations and warranties.

 

    For municipal bond securitization SPEs, in the normal course of
    dealer market-making activities, Merrill Lynch acts as liquidity
    provider. Specifically, the holders of beneficial interests
    issued by municipal bond securitization SPEs have the right to
    tender their interests for purchase by Merrill Lynch on
    specified dates at a specified price. Beneficial interests that
    are tendered are then sold by Merrill Lynch to investors through
    a best efforts remarketing where Merrill Lynch is the
    remarketing agent. If the beneficial interests are not
    successfully remarketed, the holders of beneficial interests are
    paid from funds drawn under a standby liquidity letter of credit
    issued by Merrill Lynch.

Table of Contents


    In addition to standby letters of credit, Merrill Lynch also
    provides default protection or credit enhancement to investors
    in securities issued by certain municipal bond securitization
    SPEs. Interest and principal payments on beneficial interests
    issued by these SPEs are secured by a guarantee issued by
    Merrill Lynch. In the event that the issuer of the underlying
    municipal bond defaults on any payment of principal
    and/or
    interest when due, the payments on the bonds will be made to
    beneficial interest holders from an irrevocable guarantee by
    Merrill Lynch. Additional information regarding these
    commitments is provided in Note 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

 

    The following table summarizes the total principal amounts
    outstanding and delinquencies of securitized financial assets
    held in SPEs, where Merrill Lynch holds retained interests, as

    Net credit losses associated with securitized financial assets
    held in these SPEs for the years ended December 28, 2007
    and December 29, 2006 approximated $1.1 billion and
    $180 million, respectively.

 

Mortgage
    Servicing Rights


    In connection with its residential mortgage business, Merrill
    Lynch may retain or acquire servicing rights associated with
    certain mortgage loans that are sold through its securitization
    activities. These loan sale transactions create assets referred
    to as mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs, which are included
    within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 

    In March 2006 the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, which
    amends SFAS No. 140, and requires all separately
    recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be
    initially measured at fair value, if practicable.
    SFAS No. 156 also permits servicers to subsequently
    measure each separate class of servicing assets and liabilities
    at fair value rather than at the lower of amortized cost or
    market. Merrill Lynch adopted SFAS No. 156 on
    December 30, 2006. Merrill Lynch has not elected to
    subsequently fair value those MSRs held as of the date of
    adoption or those MSRs acquired or retained after
    December 30, 2006.

 

    Retained MSRs are initially recorded at fair value and
    subsequently amortized in proportion to and over the period of
    estimated future net servicing revenues. MSRs are assessed for
    impairment, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis.
    Managements estimates of fair value of MSRs are determined
    using the net discounted present value of future cash flows,
    which consists of projecting future servicing cash flows and
    discounting such cash flows using an appropriate risk-adjusted
    discount rate. These valuations require various assumptions,
    including future servicing fees, servicing costs, credit losses,
    discount rates and mortgage prepayment speeds. Due to subsequent
    changes in economic and market conditions, these assumptions
    can, and generally will, change from quarter to quarter.

 

    Changes in Merrill Lynchs MSR balance are summarized below:

    The following table presents Merrill Lynchs key
    assumptions used in measuring the fair value of MSRs at
    December 28, 2007 and the pre-tax sensitivity of the fair
    values to an immediate 10% and 20% adverse change in these
    assumptions:

    The sensitivity analysis above is hypothetical and should be
    used with caution. In particular, the effect of a variation in a
    particular assumption on the fair value of MSRs is calculated
    independent of changes in any other assumption; in practice,
    changes in one factor may result in changes in another factor,
    which may magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Further
    changes in fair value based on a single variation in assumptions
    generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the
    change in a single assumption to the change in fair value may
    not be linear.

 

Variable Interest
    Entities


    FIN 46R requires an entity to consolidate a VIE if that
    enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority
    of the variability of the VIEs expected losses, receive a
    majority of the variability of the VIEs expected residual
    returns, or both. The entity required to consolidate a VIE is
    known as the primary beneficiary. A QSPE is a type of VIE that
    holds financial instruments and distributes cash flows to
    investors based on preset terms. QSPEs are commonly used in
    mortgage and other securitization transactions. In accordance
    with SFAS No. 140 and FIN 46R, Merrill
    Lynch typically does not consolidate QSPEs. Information
    regarding QSPEs can be found in the Securitization section of
    this Note and the Guarantees section in Note 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    Where an entity is a significant variable interest holder,
    FIN 46R requires that entity to disclose its maximum
    exposure to loss as a result of its interest in the VIE. It
    should be noted that this measure does not reflect Merrill
    Lynchs estimate of the actual losses that could result
    from adverse changes because it does not reflect the economic
    hedges Merrill Lynch enters into to reduce its exposure.

 

    The following tables summarize Merrill Lynchs involvement
    with certain VIEs as of December 28, 2007 and
    December 29, 2006, respectively. The table below does not
    include information on QSPEs or those VIEs where Merrill Lynch
    is the primary beneficiary and holds a majority of the voting
    interests in the entity.

(1)
    


The maximum exposure for guaranteed
    and other funds is the fair value of Merrill Lynchs
    investments, derivatives entered into with the VIEs if they are
    in an asset position, and liquidity and credit facilities with
    certain VIEs.
    



(2)
    


The maximum exposure for
    credit-linked note and other VIEs is the notional amount of
    total return swaps that Merrill Lynch has entered into with the

    Merrill Lynch has entered into transactions with a number of
    VIEs in which it is the primary beneficiary and therefore must
    consolidate the VIE or is a significant variable interest holder
    in the VIE. These VIEs are as follows:

 

Loan and Real
    Estate VIEs







     

    Merrill Lynch has investments in VIEs that hold loans or real
    estate. Merrill Lynch may be either the primary beneficiary
    which would result in consolidation of the VIE, or may be a
    significant variable interest holder. These VIEs include
    entities that are primarily designed to provide financing to
    clients and to invest in real estate. In addition, these VIEs
    include securitization vehicles that Merrill Lynch is required
    to consolidate because QSPE status has not been met and Merrill
    Lynch is the primary beneficiary as it retains the residual
    interests. For consolidated VIEs that hold loans, the assets of
    the VIEs are recorded in trading assets-mortgages,
    mortgage-backed and asset-backed, other assets, or loans, notes,
    and mortgages in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For
    consolidated VIEs that hold real estate investments, these real
    estate investments are included in other assets in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. The beneficial interest holders in
    these VIEs have no recourse to the general credit of Merrill
    Lynch; their investments are paid exclusively from the assets in
    the VIE. The increase in total and net asset size in the table
    above for Loan and Real Estate VIEs is a result of Merrill
    Lynchs inability to sell mortgage related securities
    because of the illiquidity in the securitization markets.
    Merrill Lynchs inability to sell certain securities
    disqualified the VIEs as QSPEs thereby resulting in Merrill
    Lynchs consolidation of the VIEs.



 

Guaranteed and
    Other Funds







     

    Merrill Lynch is the sponsor of funds that provide a guaranteed
    return to investors at the maturity of the VIE. This guarantee
    may include a guarantee of the return of an initial investment
    or of the initial investment plus an agreed upon return
    depending on the terms of the VIE. Investors in certain of these
    VIEs have recourse to Merrill Lynch to the extent that the value
    of the assets held by the VIEs at maturity is less than the
    guaranteed amount. In some instances, Merrill Lynch is the
    primary beneficiary and must consolidate the fund. Assets held
    in these VIEs are primarily classified in trading assets. In
    instances where Merrill Lynch is not the primary beneficiary,
    the guarantees related to these funds are further discussed in
    Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.


 

     

    Merrill Lynch has made certain investments in alternative
    investment fund structures that are VIEs. Merrill Lynch is the
    primary beneficiary of these funds as a result of its
    substantial investment in the vehicles. Merrill Lynch records
    its interests in these VIEs in investment securities in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets.


 

     

    Merrill Lynch has established two asset-backed commercial paper
    conduits (Conduits). Merrill Lynchs variable
    interests are in the form of 1) liquidity facilities that
    protect commercial paper holders against short term changes in
    the fair value of the assets held by the Conduits in the event
    of a disruption in the commercial paper market, and
    2) credit facilities to the Conduits that protect
    commercial paper investors against credit losses for up to a
    certain percentage of the portfolio of assets held by the
    respective Conduits. Merrill Lynch also provided a liquidity
    facility with a third Conduit that it did not establish. Merrill
    Lynchs off balance sheet exposure at December 28,
    2007, as compared to prior periods, to assets held by these
    conduits as a result of these liquidity and credit facilities is
    discussed below.



 

    During the fourth quarter of 2007, Merrill Lynch purchased the
    remaining $0.9 billion of assets of one of the Conduits
    through the exercise of its liquidity facility and as a result
    the facility is no longer outstanding.  An additional $4.0
    billion had been purchased earlier in 2007. Total losses related
    to the exercise of the facility were approximately
    $170 million in 2007. These assets are primarily
    residential mortgage backed securities.  As this Conduit is not
    active, Merrill Lynch no longer has a significant variable
    interest in this Conduit, but instead carries the assets it
    purchased in its Consolidated Financial Statements as investment
    securities  available-for-sale. Although not legally
    terminated, Merrill Lynch does not anticipate utilizing this
    Conduit for off-balance sheet financing in the future.

 

    At December 28, 2007, Merrill Lynch had liquidity and
    credit facilities outstanding or maximum exposure to loss with a
    second Conduit for $1.2 billion. The maximum exposure to
    loss assumes a total loss on the assets in the Conduit. The
    underlying assets in the Conduit are primarily auto and
    equipment loans and lease receivables totaling
    $0.9 billion. The Conduit also has unfunded loan
    commitments for $250 million. This Conduit remains active
    and continues to issue commercial paper, although during the
    latter half of 2007 there were instances when it was required to
    draw on its liquidity facility with Merrill Lynch. As of year
    end 2007, Merrill Lynch had purchased loans and asset backed
    securities under these facilities of $222 million in the
    fourth quarter and $1.1 billion earlier in 2007. Merrill Lynch
    carries these assets as loans held for investment and investment
    securities  available-for-sale, respectively. Total
    losses related to the partial exercise of the facility were
    $4 million in 2007. Merrill Lynch also periodically
    purchased commercial paper issued by this Conduit, which
    resulted in reconsideration events under FIN 46R that
    required Merrill Lynch to reassess whether it must consolidate
    the Conduit. As of the last reconsideration event, Merrill Lynch
    concluded it is not required to consolidate the Conduit and,
    additionally, no longer holds a significant variable interest.

 

    The decrease in total asset size and maximum exposure in the
    table above is attributable to Merrill Lynch no longer having a
    significant variable interest in these Merrill Lynch established
    Conduits as described above.

Table of Contents


    Merrill Lynch also provided a similar liquidity facility to a
    third party sponsored Conduit in which Merrill Lynch also held
    commercial paper. Total losses related to the exercise of the
    facility were approximately $280 million in 2007. As a
    result of a reconsideration event in the fourth quarter of 2007
    and deterioration in the value of the assets and subordinated
    notes of the Conduit, Merrill Lynch was deemed to be the primary
    beneficiary of the Conduit and the facility is no longer
    considered outstanding. The assets held by this Conduit, which
    is consolidated by Merrill Lynch, are primarily residential and
    commercial backed securities and are classified as investment
    securities  available-for-sale in Merrill
    Lynchs Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

    The liquidity and credit facilities are further discussed in
    Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 

Credit-Linked
    Note and Other VIEs







     

    Merrill Lynch has entered into transactions with VIEs where
    Merrill Lynch typically purchases credit protection from the VIE
    in the form of a derivative in order to synthetically expose
    investors to a specific credit risk. These are commonly known as
    credit-linked note VIEs. Merrill Lynch also takes synthetic
    exposure to the underlying investment grade collateral held in
    these VIEs, which primarily includes super senior U.S. sub-prime
    ABS CDOs, through total return swaps. At December 28, 2007,
    Merrill Lynchs involvement with these VIEs provides it
    with a significant variable interest. Merrill Lynch records its
    transactions with these VIEs as trading assets-derivative
    contracts in the Consolidated Financial Statements.


 

     

    In 2004, Merrill Lynch entered into a transaction with a VIE
    whereby Merrill Lynch arranged for additional protection for
    directors and employees to indemnify them against certain losses
    that they may incur as a result of claims against them. Merrill
    Lynch is the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE
    because its employees benefit from the indemnification
    arrangement. As of December 28, 2007 and December 29,
    2006 the assets of the VIE totaled approximately
    $16 million, representing a purchased credit default
    agreement, which is recorded in other assets on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. In the event of a Merrill Lynch insolvency,
    proceeds of $140 million will be received by the VIE to
    fund any claims. Neither Merrill Lynch nor its creditors have
    any recourse to the assets of the VIE.



 

Tax Planning
    VIEs







     

    Merrill Lynch has entered into transactions with VIEs that are
    used, in part, to provide tax planning strategies to investors
    and/or
    Merrill Lynch through an enhanced yield investment security.
    These structures typically provide financing to Merrill Lynch
    and/or the
    investor at enhanced rates. Merrill Lynch may be either the
    primary beneficiary of and consolidate the VIE, or may be a
    significant variable interest holder in the VIE.

Commitments are outstanding as of
    the date the commitment letter is issued and are comprised of
    closed and contingent commitments. Closed commitments represent
    the unfunded portion of existing commitments available for draw
    down. Contingent commitments are contingent on the borrower
    fulfilling certain conditions or upon a particular event, such
    as an acquisition. A portion of these contingent commitments may
    be syndicated among other lenders or replaced with capital
    markets funding.

In addition to the loan origination
    commitments included in the table above, at December 28,
    2007, Merrill Lynch entered into agreements to purchase
    $330 million of loans that, upon settlement of the
    commitment, will be classified in loans held for investment and
    loans held for sale. Similar loan purchase commitments totaled
    $1.2 billion at December 29, 2006. See Note 11 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Primarily relates to activity
    related to loans and lease receivables transferred to
    held-for-sale in connection with the disposition of
    Merrill Lynch Capital, offset by allowance for loan losses
    acquired in connection with the acquisition of First Republic.
    


 

    Consumer loans, which are substantially secured, consisted of
    approximately 245,100 individual loans at December 28,
    2007. Commercial loans consisted of approximately 23,200
    separate loans. The principal balance of non-accrual loans was
    $607 million at December 28, 2007 and
    $209 million at December 29, 2006. The investment
    grade and non-investment grade categorization is determined
    using the credit rating agency equivalent of internal credit
    ratings. Non-investment grade counterparties are those rated
    lower than the BBB- category. In some cases Merrill Lynch enters
    into single name and index credit default swaps to mitigate
    credit exposure related to funded and unfunded commercial loans.
    The notional value of these swaps totaled $16.1 billion and
    $11.2 billion at December 28, 2007 and
    December 29, 2006, respectively. For information on credit
    risk management see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

 

    The above amounts include $49.0 billion and
    $18.6 billion of loans held for sale at December 28,
    2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively. Loans held for
    sale are loans that management expects to sell prior to
    maturity. At December 28, 2007, such loans consisted of
    $11.6 billion of consumer loans, primarily residential
    mortgages and automobile loans, and $37.4 billion of
    commercial loans, approximately 19% of which are to investment
    grade counterparties. At December 29, 2006, such loans
    consisted of $7.4 billion of consumer loans, primarily
    residential mortgages and automobile loans, and
    $11.2 billion of commercial loans, approximately 38% of
    which are to investment grade counterparties.

 

    The fair values of loans, notes, and mortgages were
    approximately $95 billion and $73 billion at
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively.
    Merrill Lynch estimates the fair value of loans utilizing a
    number of methods ranging from market price quotations to
    discounted cash flows.

Table of Contents


    Merrill Lynch generally maintains collateral on secured loans in
    the form of securities, liens on real estate, perfected security
    interests in other assets of the borrower, and guarantees.
    Consumer loans are typically collateralized by liens on real
    estate, automobiles, and other property. Commercial secured
    loans primarily include asset-based loans secured by financial
    assets such as loan receivables and trade receivables where the
    amount of the loan is based on the level of available collateral
    (i.e., the borrowing base) and commercial mortgages secured by
    real property. In addition, for secured commercial loans related
    to the corporate and institutional lending business, Merrill
    Lynch typically receives collateral in the form of either a
    first or second lien on the assets of the borrower or the stock
    of a subsidiary, which gives Merrill Lynch a priority claim in
    the case of a bankruptcy filing by the borrower. In many cases,
    where a security interest in the assets of the borrower is
    granted, no restrictions are placed on the use of assets by the
    borrower and asset levels are not typically subject to periodic
    review; however, the borrowers are typically subject to
    stringent debt covenants. Where the borrower grants a security
    interest in the stock of its subsidiary, the subsidiarys
    ability to issue additional debt is typically restricted.

 

    Merrill Lynch enters into commitments to extend credit,
    predominantly at variable interest rates, in connection with
    corporate finance and loan syndication transactions. Customers
    may also be extended loans or lines of credit collateralized by
    first and second mortgages on real estate, certain assets of
    small businesses, or securities. Merrill Lynch considers
    commitments to be outstanding as of the date the commitment
    letter is issued. These commitments usually have a fixed
    expiration date and are contingent on certain contractual
    conditions that may require payment of a fee by the
    counterparty. Once commitments are drawn upon, Merrill Lynch may
    require the counterparty to post collateral depending on its
    creditworthiness and general market conditions.

 

    Merrill Lynch originates and purchases portfolios of loans that
    have certain features that may be viewed as increasing Merrill
    Lynchs exposure to nonpayment risk by the borrower. In
    connection with the acquisition of First Franklin on
    December 30, 2006, Merrill Lynch acquired sub-prime
    mortgage loans and originated a significant volume of sub-prime
    mortgage loans during the first half of 2007. As the year
    developed, delinquencies and defaults in the sub-prime mortgage
    loan market increased significantly leading to tighter
    underwriting criteria for new mortgages. As a result, First
    Franklin substantially reduced its sub-prime lending activities
    and currently is only making loans that are underwritten to
    prime underwriting criteria. As of December 28, 2007, we
    have ceased originating sub-prime mortgages and are evaluating
    our continued involvement in this market. In addition, Merrill
    Lynch acquired loans that have these features in connection with
    the acquisition of First Republic (see Note 16 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements). Specifically, these loans
    include commercial and residential loans held in loans, notes,
    and mortgages as of December 28, 2007 that have the
    following features:

 






     

    negative amortizing features that permit the borrower to draw on
    unfunded commitments to pay current interest
    (commercial loans only);


 

     

    subject the borrower to payment increases over the life of the
    loan; and


 

     

    high LTV ratios.



 

    Although these features may be considered non-traditional for
    residential mortgages, interest-only features are considered
    traditional for commercial loans. Therefore, the table below
    includes only those commercial loans with features that permit
    negative amortization.

 

    The table below summarizes the level of exposure to each type of
    loan at December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006:

Includes loans from securitizations
    where due to Merrill Lynchs inability to sell certain
    securities disqualified the VIEs as QSPEs thereby resulting in
    Merrill Lynchs consolidation of the VIEs. Merrill
    Lynchs exposure is limited to (i) any retained
    interest and (ii) the representations and warranties made
    upon securitization (See Note 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements).
    


 

    The negative amortizing loan products that Merrill Lynch issues
    include loans where the small- and middle-market or commercial
    borrower receives a loan and an unfunded commitment, which
    together equal the maximum amount Merrill Lynch is willing to
    lend. The unfunded commitment is automatically drawn on in order
    to meet current interest payments. These loans are often made to
    real estate developers where the financed property will not
    generate current income at the beginning of the loan term. This
    balance also includes working capital lines of credit that are
    issued to small- and middle-market investors and are secured by
    the assets of the business.

 

    Loans where borrowers may be subject to payment increases
    primarily include interest-only loans. This caption also
    includes mortgages with low initial rates. These loans are
    underwritten based on a variety of factors including, for
    example, the borrowers credit history, debt to income
    ratio, employment, the LTV ratio, and the borrowers
    disposable income and cash reserves; typically using a
    qualifying formula that conforms to the guidance issued by the
    federal banking agencies with respect to non-traditional
    mortgage loans.





  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report

Table of Contents


In instances where the borrower is
    of lower credit standing, the loans are typically underwritten
    to have a lower LTV ratio
    and/or other
    mitigating factors.
    

 

    High LTV loans include all mortgage loans where the LTV is
    greater than 80% and the borrower has not purchased private
    mortgage insurance (PMI). High LTV loans also
    include residential mortgage products where a mortgage and home
    equity loan are simultaneously established for the same
    property. The maximum original LTV ratio for the mortgage
    portfolio with no PMI or other security is 85%, which can, on an
    exception basis, be extended to 90%. In addition, the Mortgage
    100| product is included in this category. The Mortgage 100|
    product permits high credit quality borrowers to pledge eligible
    securities in lieu of a traditional down payment. The securities
    portfolio is subject to daily monitoring, and additional
    collateral is required if the value of the pledged securities
    declines below certain levels.

 

    The contractual amounts of these commitments represent the
    amounts at risk should the contract be fully drawn upon, the
    client defaults, and the value of the existing collateral
    becomes worthless. The total amount of outstanding commitments
    may not represent future cash requirements, as commitments may
    expire without being drawn upon. For a maturity profile of these
    and other commitments see Note 11 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

 










   Note 8. Goodwill
    and Intangibles



 










   Goodwill
    




    Goodwill is the cost of an acquired company in excess of the
    fair value of identifiable net assets at acquisition date.
    Goodwill is tested annually (or more frequently under certain
    conditions) for impairment at the reporting unit level in
    accordance with SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets.

 

    The following table sets forth the changes in the carrying
    amount of Merrill Lynchs goodwill by business segment, for
    the years-ended December 28, 2007 and December 29,
    2006:

MLIM ceased to exist in connection
    with the BlackRock merger in September 2006.
    


 

    GWM 2007 activity primarily relates to goodwill acquired in
    connection with the acquisition of First Republic. The change in
    the recorded amount of goodwill for GMI relates primarily to
    goodwill acquired in connection with the acquisition of First
    Franklin whose operations were integrated into GMIs
    mortgage securitization business. GMI 2006 activity primarily
    relates to goodwill acquired in connection with investments in
    an Indian joint venture and a boutique investment banking
    company. At December 28, 2007, in response to the
    deterioration in the sub-prime mortgage markets, Merrill Lynch
    performed a goodwill impairment test. Based on this test,
    Merrill Lynch determined that there was no impairment of
    goodwill on a consolidated basis.

 

    In connection with the BlackRock merger, the goodwill associated
    with the MLIM business was derecognized on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheet as of September 29, 2006.

 










   Intangible
    Assets
    




    Intangible assets at December 28, 2007 consist primarily of
    value assigned to customer relationships and core deposits.
    Intangible assets with definite lives are tested for impairment
    in accordance with SFAS No. 144 whenever certain
    conditions exist which would indicate the carrying amounts of
    such assets may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with
    definite lives are amortized over their respective estimated
    useful lives.

 

    In connection with the acquisition of First Franklin in 2007,
    Merrill Lynch recorded identifiable intangible assets of
    $185 million. In response to the deterioration in the
    sub-prime mortgage markets, Merrill Lynch reviewed its
    identifiable intangible assets for impairment and recorded
    impairment charges of $107 million and $53 million
    related to mortgage broker relationships of First Franklin in
    the third and fourth quarters of 2007, respectively. At
    December 28, 2007 the entire amount of mortgage broker
    relationships has been written off.

   Note 9. Borrowings
    and Deposits




    ML & Co. is the primary issuer of all of Merrill
    Lynchs debt instruments. For local tax or regulatory
    reasons, debt is also issued by certain subsidiaries.

 

    The value of Merrill Lynchs debt instruments as recorded
    on the Consolidated Balance Sheet does not necessarily represent
    the amount at which they will be repaid at maturity. This is due
    to the following:

 






     

    Certain debt issuances are issued at a discount to their
    redemption amount, which will accrete up to the redemption
    amount as they approach maturity;


 

     

    Certain debt issuances are accounted for at fair value and
    incorporate changes in Merrill Lynchs creditworthiness as
    well as other underlying risks (see Note 3 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements);


 

     

    Certain structured notes whose coupon or repayment terms are
    linked to the performance of debt and equity securities,
    indices, currencies or commodities will take into consideration
    the fair value of those risks; and


 

     

    Certain debt issuances are adjusted for the impact of the
    application of fair value hedge accounting (see Note 1 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements).

    The fair value of short-term borrowings approximated carrying
    values at December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006.

 

    In determining fair value of
    long-term
    borrowings at December 28, 2007 for the purposes of the
    disclosure requirements under SFAS No. 107,
    Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, an
    entitys own creditworthiness is required to be
    incorporated into the fair value measurements per the guidance
    in SFAS No. 157. The fair value of total long-term
    borrowings is estimated using a discounted cash flow model with
    inputs for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The fair
    value of long-term borrowings at December 28, 2007 that are
    not accounted for at fair value under SFAS No. 159 was
    approximately $9.0 billion less than the carrying amount
    primarily due to the widening of Merrill Lynch credit spreads.
    In addition, the amount of long-term borrowings that are
    accounted for at fair value under SFAS No. 159 was
    approximately $76.3 billion at December 28, 2007. The
    credit spread component for the long-term borrowings carried at
    fair value was $2.0 billion and has been included in
    earnings. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information. At December 29,
    2006, the fair value of long-term borrowings approximated
    carrying amounts.

    Certain long-term borrowing agreements contain provisions
    whereby the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the
    holder (put options) at specified dates prior to
    maturity. These borrowings are reflected in the above table as
    maturing at their put dates, rather than their contractual
    maturities. Management believes, however, that a portion of such
    borrowings will remain outstanding beyond their earliest
    redemption date.

 

    A limited number of notes whose coupon or repayment terms are
    linked to the performance of debt and equity securities,
    indices, currencies or commodities may be accelerated based on
    the value of a referenced index or security, in which case
    Merrill Lynch may be required to immediately settle the
    obligation for cash or other securities. Refer to Note 1 to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements, Embedded Derivatives
    section for additional information.

 

    Except for the $2.2 billion of aggregate principal amount
    of floating rate zero-coupon contingently convertible liquid
    yield option notes (LYONs®) that were
    outstanding at December 28, 2007, senior and subordinated
    debt obligations issued by ML & Co. and senior debt
    issued by subsidiaries and guaranteed by ML & Co. do
    not contain provisions that could, upon an adverse change in
    ML & Co.s credit rating, financial ratios,
    earnings, cash flows, or stock price, trigger a requirement for
    an early payment, additional collateral support, changes in
    terms, acceleration of maturity, or the creation of an
    additional financial obligation.

 

    The effective weighted-average interest rates for borrowings at
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006 were as

Floating Rate
    LYONs®


    At December 28, 2007, $2.2 billion of LYONs® were
    outstanding. The LYONs® are unsecured and unsubordinated
    indebtedness of Merrill Lynch and mature in 2032.

 

    At maturity, holders of the LYONs® will receive the
    original principal amount of $1,000 increased daily by a rate
    that resets on a quarterly basis. Upon conversion, holders of
    the LYONs® will receive the value of 14.0915 shares of
    Merrill Lynch common stock based on the conditions described
    below. This value will be paid in cash in an amount equal to the
    contingent principal amount of the LYONs® on the conversion
    date and the remainder, at Merrill Lynchs election, will
    be paid in cash, common stock or a combination thereof.

 

    In addition, under the terms of the LYONs®:

 






     

    Merrill Lynch may redeem the LYONs® at any time on or after
    March 13, 2008.


 

     

    Investors may require Merrill Lynch to repurchase the
    LYONs® in March 2008, 2012, 2017, 2022 and 2027.
    Repurchases may be settled only in cash.


 

     

    Until March 2008, the conversion rate on the LYONS® will be
    adjusted upon the issuance of a quarterly cash dividend to
    holders of Merrill Lynch common stock to the extent that such
    dividend exceeds $0.16 per share. In 2007, Merrill Lynchs
    common stock dividend exceeded $0.16 per share and, as a result,
    Merrill Lynch adjusted the conversion ratio to 14.0915 from
    13.9447 in February 2008. In addition, the conversion rate on
    the LYONs® will be adjusted for any other cash dividends or
    distributions to all holders of Merrill Lynch common stock until
    March 2008. After March 2008, cash dividends and distributions
    will cause the conversion ratio to be adjusted only to the
    extent such dividends are extraordinary.

     

    The conversion rate on the LYONs® will also adjust upon:
    (1) dividends or distributions payable in Merrill Lynch
    common stock, (2) subdivisions, combinations or certain
    reclassifications of Merrill Lynch common stock,
    (3) distributions to all holders of Merrill Lynch common
    stock of certain rights to purchase the stock at less than the
    sale price of Merrill Lynch common stock at that time, and
    (4) distributions of Merrill Lynch assets or debt
    securities to holders of Merrill Lynch common stock (including
    certain cash dividends and distributions as described above).



 

    The LYONs® may be converted based on any of the following
    conditions:

 






     

    If the closing price of Merrill Lynch common stock for at least
    20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last
    day of the calendar quarter is more than the conversion trigger
    price. The conversion trigger price for the LYONs® at
    December 28, 2007 was $93.11. That is, between
    January 1, 2008 and February 15, 2008, a holder could
    have converted LYONs® into the value of 13.9447 shares
    of Merrill Lynch common stock if the Merrill Lynch stock price
    had been greater than $93.11 for at least 20 of the last 30
    consecutive trading days ending December 28, 2007;


 

     

    During any period in which the credit rating of the LYONs®
    is Baa1 or lower by Moodys Investor Services, Inc., BBB+
    or lower by Standard & Poors Credit Market
    Services, or BBB+ or lower by Fitch, Inc.;


 

     

    If the LYONs® are called for redemption;


 

     

    If Merrill Lynch is party to a consolidation, merger or binding
    share exchange; or


 

     

    If Merrill Lynch makes a distribution that has a per share value
    equal to more than 15% of the sale price of its shares on the
    day preceding the declaration date for such distribution.



 

    In accordance with the guidance in EITF Topic No.
    90-19,
Convertible Bonds with Issuer Option to Settle for Cash upon
    Conversion, and EITF
    No. 03-7,
Accounting for the Settlement of the Equity-Settled Portion
    of a Convertible Debt Instrument That Permits or Requires the
    Conversion Spread to Be Settled in Stock (Instrument C of Issue
    90-19),
    Merrill Lynch accounts for the proceeds received from the
    issuance of LYONs® as long-term borrowings. Merrill Lynch

   Junior
    Subordinated Notes (related to trust preferred securities)
    




    As of December 28, 2007, Merrill Lynch has created six
    trusts that have issued preferred securities to the public
    (trust preferred securities). Merrill Lynch
    Preferred Capital Trust III, IV and V used the issuance
    proceeds to purchase Partnership Preferred Securities,
    representing limited partnership interests. Using the purchase
    proceeds, the limited partnerships extended junior subordinated
    loans to ML & Co. and one or more subsidiaries of
    ML & Co. Merrill Lynch Capital Trust I, II
    and III directly invested in junior subordinated notes
    issued by ML & Co.

 

    ML & Co. has guaranteed, on a junior subordinated
    basis, the payment in full of all distributions and other
    payments on the trust preferred securities to the extent that
    the trusts have funds legally available. This guarantee and
    similar partnership distribution guarantees are subordinated to
    all other liabilities of ML & Co. and rank equally
    with preferred stock of ML & Co.

 

    The following table summarizes Merrill Lynchs trust
    preferred securities as of December 28, 2007.

   Borrowing
    Facilities
    




    Merrill Lynch maintains credit facilities that are available to
    cover immediate funding needs. Merrill Lynch maintains a
    committed three-year, multi-currency, unsecured bank credit
    facility that totaled $4.0 billion and $4.5 billion at
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively.
    This facility permits borrowings by ML & Co. and
    expires in April 2010. At December 28, 2007 Merrill Lynch
    had $1.0 billion of borrowings outstanding under this
    facility. This facility requires Merrill Lynch to maintain a
    minimum consolidated net worth which it significantly exceeded.
    There were no borrowings outstanding as of December 29,
    2006.

 

    Merrill Lynch also maintains two committed, secured credit
    facilities which totaled $6.5 billion at December 28,
    2007 and $7.5 billion at December 29, 2006. The
    facilities expire in May 2008 and December 2008. Both facilities
    include a one-year term-out option that allows ML &
    Co. to extend borrowings under the facilities for an additional
    year beyond their respective expiration dates. The secured
    facilities permit borrowings by ML & Co. and select
    subsidiaries, secured by a broad range of collateral. At
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, there were no
    borrowings outstanding under either facility.

 

    In addition, Merrill Lynch maintains committed, secured credit
    facilities with two financial institutions that totaled
    $11.75 billion at December 28, 2007 and
    December 29, 2006. The secured facilities may be
    collateralized by government obligations eligible for pledging.
    The facilities expire at various dates through 2014, but may be
    terminated earlier with at least a nine-month notice by either
    party. At December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006,
    there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities.

    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively.
    


 

    Certificates of deposit and other time deposit accounts issued
    in amounts of $100,000 or more totaled $5.8 billion and
    $3.3 billion at December 28, 2007 and
    December 29, 2006, respectively. At December 28, 2007,
    $2.6 billion of these deposits mature in three months or
    less, $2.5 billion mature in more than three but less than
    six months and the remaining balance matures in more than six
    months.

 

    The effective weighted-average interest rates for deposits,
    which include the impact of hedges, at both December 28,
    2007 and December 29, 2006, was 3.5%. The fair values of
    deposits approximated carrying values at December 28, 2007
    and December 29, 2006.

 










   Other
    




    Merrill Lynch also obtains standby letters of credit from
    issuing banks to satisfy various counterparty collateral
    requirements, in lieu of depositing cash or securities
    collateral. Such standby letters of credit aggregated
    $5.8 billion and $2.5 billion at December 28,
    2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively.

 










   Note 10. Stockholders
    Equity and Earnings Per Share



 










   Preferred
    Equity
    




    ML & Co. is authorized to issue
    25 million shares of undesignated preferred stock,
    $1.00 par value per share. All shares of currently
    outstanding preferred stock constitute one and the same class
    and have equal rank and priority over common stockholders as to
    dividends and in the event of liquidation. All shares are
    perpetual, non-cumulative and dividends are payable quarterly
    when, and if, declared by the Board of Directors. Each share of
    preferred stock of Series 1 through Series 5 has a
    liquidation preference of $30,000, is represented by 1,200
    depositary shares and is redeemable at Merrill Lynchs
    option at a redemption price equal to $30,000 plus declared and
    unpaid dividends, without accumulation of any undeclared
    dividends.

 

    On September 21, 2007, in connection with the acquisition
    of First Republic, Merrill Lynch issued two new series of
    preferred stock, $65 million in aggregate principal amount
    of 6.70% Non-Cumulative, Perpetual Preferred Stock,
    Series 6, and $50 million in aggregate principal
    amount of 6.25% Non-Cumulative, Perpetual Preferred Stock,
    Series 7. Each share of preferred stock of series 6 and 7
    has a

   Mandatory
    Convertible
    




    On January 15, 2008, Merrill Lynch reached separate
    agreements with several long-term investors, primarily Korea
    Investment Corporation, Kuwait Investment Authority and Mizuho
    Corporate Bank, to sell an aggregate of 66 thousand shares
    of newly issued 9.00% Non-Voting Mandatory Convertible
    Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1.00
    per share and liquidation preference $100,000 per share (the
    Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock), at a price
    of $100,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of
    approximately $6.6 billion. The shares of Mandatory
    Convertible Preferred Stock were issued on various dates between
    January 17, 2008 and February 1, 2008. Subject to
    certain conditions and exceptions, if Merrill Lynch sells or
    agrees to sell more than $1 billion of any common stock (or
    equity securities convertible into common stock) within one year
    of closing at a purchase, conversion or reference price per
    share less than $52.40, then the conversion ratio for the
    mandatory convertible preferred stock shall be adjusted to
    compensate the investors.

 










   Common
    Stock
    




    On December 24, 2007, Merrill Lynch reached agreements with
    each of Temasek Capital (Private) Limited (Temasek)
    and Davis Selected Advisors LP (Davis) to sell an
    aggregate of 116.7 million shares of newly issued common
    stock, par value
    $1.331/3
    per share, at $48.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price
    of approximately $5.6 billion.

 

    Davis purchased 25 million shares of Merrill Lynch common
    stock on December 27, 2007 at a price per share of $48.00,
    or an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion. Temasek
    purchased 55 million shares on December 28, 2007 and
    the remaining 36.7 million shares on January 11, 2008.
    In addition, Merrill Lynch granted Temasek an option to purchase
    an additional 12.5 million shares of common stock under
    certain circumstances. This option was exercised, with
    2.8 million shares issued on February 1, 2008 and
    9.7 million shares issued on February 5, 2008, in each
    case at a purchase price of $48.00 per share for an aggregate
    purchase price of $600 million.

 

    In connection with the Temasek transaction, if Merrill Lynch
    sells or agrees to sell any common stock (or equity securities
    convertible into common stock) within one year of closing at a
    purchase, conversion or reference price per share less than
    $48.00, then it must make a payment to Temasek to compensate
    Temasek for the aggregate excess amount per share paid by
    Temasek, which is settled in cash or common stock at Merrill
    Lynchs option.

 

    Upon closing the First Republic acquisition on
    September 21, 2007, Merrill Lynch issued 11.6 million
    shares of common stock as a portion of the consideration.

 

    On January 18, 2007, the Board of Directors declared a 40%
    increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.35 per common
    share, from $0.25 per common share. Dividends paid on common
    stock were $1.40 per share in 2007, $1.00 per share in
    2006, and $0.76 per 
    share in 2005.

    During 2007, Merrill Lynch repurchased 62.1 million common
    shares at an average repurchase price of $84.88 per share. On
    April 30, 2007 the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of an additional $6 billion of Merrill
    Lynchs outstanding common shares. During 2007, Merrill
    Lynch had completed the $5 billion repurchase program
    authorized in October 2006 and had $4.0 billion of
    authorized repurchase capacity remaining under the repurchase
    program authorized in April 2007. Merrill Lynch did not
    repurchase any common stock during the fourth quarter of 2007
    and does not anticipate additional repurchases of common shares.

   Earnings
    Per Share
    




    Basic EPS is calculated by dividing earnings available to common
    stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares
    outstanding. Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS, but adjusts
    for the effect of the potential issuance of common shares. The
    following table presents the computations of basic and diluted
    EPS:

   Note 11. Commitments,
    Contingencies and Guarantees



 

Litigation


    Merrill Lynch has been named as a defendant in various legal
    actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other
    litigation arising in connection with its activities as a global
    diversified financial services institution.

 

    Some of the legal actions include claims for substantial
    compensatory
    and/or
    punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.
    In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary
    defendants in such cases are bankrupt or otherwise in financial
    distress. Merrill Lynch is also involved in investigations
    and/or
    proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies.

 

    Merrill Lynch believes it has strong defenses to, and where
    appropriate, will vigorously contest, many of these matters.
    Given the number of these matters, some are likely to result in
    adverse judgments, penalties, injunctions, fines, or other
    relief. Merrill Lynch may explore potential settlements before a
    case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty, risks,
    and costs inherent in the litigation process. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies,
    Merrill Lynch will accrue a liability when it is probable
    that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss
    can be reasonably estimated. In many lawsuits and arbitrations,
    including almost all of the class action lawsuits, it is not
    possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or
    to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability
    until the case is close to resolution, in which case no accrual
    is made until that time. In view of the inherent difficulty of
    predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases in
    which claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages,
    Merrill Lynch cannot predict what the eventual loss or range of
    loss related to such matters will be. Merrill Lynch continues to
    assess these cases and believes, based on information available
    to it, that the resolution of these matters will not have a
    material adverse effect on the

Specific
    Litigation

 

IPO Underwriting
    Fee Litigation


In re Public Offering Fee Antitrust Litigation and In re
    Issuer Plaintiff Initial Public Offering Fee Antitrust
    Litigation: Beginning in 1998, Merrill Lynch was
    named as one of approximately two dozen defendants in purported
    class actions filed in the United States District Court for the
    Southern District of New York alleging that underwriters
    conspired to fix the fee paid to purchase certain
    initial public offering securities at 7% in violation of
    antitrust laws. These complaints have been filed by both
    investors and issuers in initial public offerings. On
    February 24, 2004, the court held that the purchaser
    plaintiffs claims for damages were barred, but declined to
    dismiss the claim for injunctive relief. On April 18, 2006,
    the court held that the issuer claim could not proceed as a
    class action. On September 11, 2007, the Second Circuit
    Court of Appeals vacated the April 18 decision and remanded the
    case for further proceedings on the issue of class
    certification. Following the remand, plaintiffs have moved for
    class certification of the issuer class, and the defendants have
    opposed class certification. The court has not issued a decision
    on the class certification issue.

 

IPO Allocation
    Litigation


In re Initial Public Offering Securities
    Litigation: Beginning in 2001, Merrill Lynch was
    named as one of the defendants in approximately 110 securities
    class action complaints alleging that dozens of underwriter
    defendants artificially inflated and maintained the stock prices
    of securities by creating an artificially high post-IPO demand
    for shares. On October 13, 2004, the district court, having
    previously denied defendants motions to dismiss, issued an
    order allowing certain of these cases to proceed against the
    underwriter defendants as class actions. On December 5,
    2006, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this order,
    holding that the district court erred in certifying these cases
    as class actions. On September 27, 2007, plaintiffs again
    moved for class certification. On December 21, 2007,
    defendants filed their opposition to plaintiffs motion.
    The court has not issued a decision on the class certification
    issue.

 

Enron
    Litigation


Newby v. Enron Corp. et al.: On
    April 8, 2002, Merrill Lynch was added as a defendant in a
    consolidated class action filed in the United States District
    Court for the Southern District of Texas on behalf of the
    purchasers of Enrons publicly traded equity and debt
    securities during the period October 19, 1998 through
    November 27, 2001. The complaint alleges, among other
    things, that Merrill Lynch engaged in improper transactions in
    the fourth quarter of 1999 that helped Enron misrepresent its
    earnings and revenues in the fourth quarter of 1999. The
    district court denied Merrill Lynchs motions to dismiss,
    and certified a class action by Enron shareholders and
    bondholders against Merrill Lynch and other defendants. On
    March 19, 2007, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed
    the district courts decision certifying the case as a
    class action. On January 22, 2008, the Supreme Court denied
    plaintiffs petition to review the Fifth Circuits
    decision. Merrill Lynch intends to move for summary judgment
    dismissing the action. Plaintiffs have stated they will oppose
    that motion.

 

Mortgage-Related
    Litigation


Merrill Lynch & Co. Shareholder
    Litigation: Beginning on October 30, 2007,
    purported class actions were filed in the United States District
    Court for the Southern District of New York against Merrill
    Lynch and certain present or former officers and directors on
    behalf of persons who acquired Merrill Lynch securities
    beginning as early as November 3, 2006 and ending as late
    as November 7, 2007. Among other things, the complaints
    allege violations of the federal securities laws based on
    alleged false and misleading statements related to Merrill
    Lynchs exposure to collateralized debt obligations and the
    sub-prime lending markets. One such action is brought on behalf
    of persons who exchanged the securities of First Republic Bank
    for the securities of Merrill Lynch in a merger that occurred on
    September 21, 2007. Merrill Lynch intends to vigorously
    defend itself in these actions.

 

Shareholder Derivative Actions: Beginning on
    November 1, 2007, purported shareholder derivative actions
    were brought in federal and state courts against certain present
    or former officers and directors of Merrill Lynch in which the
    Company is named as a nominal defendant. The actions allege,
    among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste,
    and abuse of control related to Merrill Lynchs exposure to
    collateralized debt obligations and the sub-prime lending
    markets. They also challenge the payment of alleged severance to
    Merrill Lynchs former chief executive officer and certain
    of the actions assert claims for contribution or indemnification
    on the Companys behalf. In addition, the Company has
    received letters from law firms, on behalf of purported
    shareholders, demanding that the Board bring claims on behalf of
    Merrill Lynch against certain present and former directors and
    officers of Merrill Lynch based on allegations substantially
    similar to those that are alleged in the shareholder derivative
    actions described above. The Board, with the assistance of
    counsel, will review the claims made in the demand letters and
    determine whether the maintenance of the proposed derivative
    suits is in the best interests of the Company.

 

ERISA Litigation: Beginning on
    November 13, 2007, purported class actions were filed in
    the United States District Court for the Southern District of
    New York against Merrill Lynch and certain of its present or
    former officers and directors on behalf of the Merrill Lynch
    401(k) Savings and Investment Plan, Retirement Accumulation
    Plan, Employee Stock Ownership Plan and a class of similarly
    situated plan participants. The actions are pending in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York. These actions challenge

Table of Contents


    the Companys disclosures about its performance, business
    prospects and the attractiveness of the Companys stock
    between a variety of purported class periods, beginning as early
    as January 1, 2004 and ending as late as December 6,
    2007. Merrill Lynch intends to vigorously defend itself in these
    actions.

 

City of Cleveland v. Deutsche Bank Trust Company, et
    al.: On January 10, 2008, the City of
    Cleveland filed a lawsuit against twenty-one financial services
    firms, including Merrill Lynch, alleging that the securitization
    of sub-prime mortgages created a public nuisance and
    that defendants are, therefore, liable for the cost incurred by
    the City of Cleveland related to foreclosures. The case was
    initially filed in the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court and
    was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Ohio on January 17, 2008. Plaintiff has filed a
    motion seeking an order remanding the case. Merrill Lynch
    intends to vigorously defend itself in this action.

 

Regulatory Investigations: Merrill Lynch is
    cooperating with the SEC and other regulators and governmental
    authorities investigating sub-prime mortgage-related activities.

 

Bank Sweep
    Programs Litigation


DeBlasio v. Merrill Lynch, et al.: On
    January 12, 2007, a purported class action was brought
    against Merrill Lynch and three other securities firms in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York alleging that their bank sweep programs violated state law
    because their terms were not adequately disclosed to customers.
    On May 1, 2007, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,
    which added additional defendants. On November 12, 2007,
    defendants filed motions to dismiss the second amended
    complaint. Briefing on the motion is expected to be completed by
    March 6, 2008.

 

Private Equity
    Litigation


Davidson, et al., v. Bain Capital Partners, LLC, et
    al.: On December 28, 2007, a purported class
    action was brought against sixteen defendants, including Merrill
    Lynch, in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts. The complaint alleges that defendants conspired
    to limit competition in bidding for private-equity sponsored
    acquisitions of public companies in violation of the antitrust
    laws. Merrill Lynch intends to vigorously defend itself in this
    action.

Lending
    Commitments


    Merrill Lynch primarily enters into commitments to extend
    credit, predominantly at variable interest rates, in connection
    with corporate finance, corporate and institutional transactions
    and asset-based lending transactions. Clients may also be
    extended loans or lines of credit collateralized by first and
    second mortgages on real estate, certain liquid assets of small
    businesses, or securities. These commitments usually have a
    fixed expiration date and are contingent on certain contractual
    conditions that may require payment of a fee by the
    counterparty. Once commitments are drawn upon, Merrill Lynch may
    require the counterparty to post collateral depending upon
    creditworthiness and general market conditions. See Note 7
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    information.

 

    The contractual amounts of these commitments represent the
    amounts at risk should the contract be fully drawn upon, the
    client defaults, and the value of the existing collateral
    becomes worthless. The total amount of outstanding commitments
    may not represent future cash requirements, as commitments may
    expire without being drawn upon.

 

    For lending commitments where the loan will be classified as
    held for sale upon funding, liabilities are calculated at the
    lower of cost or market, capturing declines in the fair value of
    the respective credit risk. For loan commitments where the loan
    will be classified as held for investment upon funding,
    liabilities are calculated considering both market and
    historical loss rates. Loan commitments held by entities that
    apply broker-dealer industry level accounting are accounted for
    at fair value.

Table of Contents


Purchasing and
    Other Commitments


    In the normal course of business, Merrill Lynch enters into
    institutional and margin-lending transactions, some of which are
    on a committed basis, but most of which are not. Margin lending
    on a committed basis only includes amounts where Merrill Lynch
    has a binding commitment. These binding margin lending
    commitments totaled $693 million at December 28, 2007
    and $782 million at December 29, 2006.

 

    Merrill Lynch had commitments to purchase partnership interests,
    primarily related to private equity and principal investing
    activities, of $3.1 billion and $928 million at
    December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006, respectively.
    Merrill Lynch also has entered into agreements with providers of
    market data, communications, systems consulting, and other
    office-related services. At December 28, 2007 and
    December 29, 2006, minimum fee commitments over the
    remaining life of these agreements aggregated $453 million
    and $357 million, respectively. Merrill Lynch entered into
    commitments to purchase loans of $3.0 billion (which upon
    settlement of the commitment will be included in trading assets,
    loans held for investment and loans held for sale) at
    December 28, 2007. Such commitments totaled
    $10.3 billion at December 29, 2006. Other purchasing
    commitments amounted to $0.9 billion and $2.1 billion
    at December 28, 2007 and December 29, 2006,
    respectively.

 

    In the normal course of business, Merrill Lynch enters into
    commitments for underwriting transactions. Settlement of these
    transactions as of December 28, 2007 would not have a
    material effect on the consolidated financial condition of
    Merrill Lynch.

 

    In connection with trading activities, Merrill Lynch enters into
    commitments to enter into resale and securities borrowing and
    also repurchase and securities lending agreements that are
    primarily secured by collateral.

 

Leases


    Merrill Lynch has entered into various noncancellable long-term
    lease agreements for premises that expire through 2024. Merrill
    Lynch has also entered into various noncancellable short-term
    lease agreements, which are primarily commitments of less than
    one year under equipment leases.

 

    Merrill Lynch leases its Hopewell, New Jersey campus and an
    aircraft from a limited partnership. The leases with the limited
    partnership are accounted for as operating leases and mature in
    2009. Each lease has a renewal term to 2014. In addition,
    Merrill Lynch has entered into guarantees with the limited
    partnership, whereby if Merrill Lynch does not renew the lease
    or purchase the assets under its lease at the end of either the
    initial or the renewal lease term, the underlying assets will be
    sold to a third party, and Merrill Lynch has guaranteed that the
    proceeds of such sale will amount to at least 84% of the
    acquisition cost of the assets. The maximum exposure to Merrill
    Lynch as a result of this residual value guarantee is
    approximately $322 million as of December 28, 2007 and
    December 29, 2006. As of December 28, 2007 and
    December 29, 2006, the carrying value of the liability on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets is $13 million and
    $17 million, respectively. Merrill Lynchs residual
    value guarantee does not comprise more than half of the limited
    partnerships assets.

 

    On June 19, 2007, Merrill Lynch sold its ownership interest
    in Chapterhouse Holdings Limited, whose primary asset is Merrill
    Lynchs London Headquarters, for approximately
    $950 million. Merrill Lynch leased the premises back for an
    initial term of 15 years under an agreement which is
    classified as an operating lease. The leaseback also includes
    renewal rights extending significantly beyond the initial term.
    The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately
    $370 million which was deferred and is being recognized
    over the lease term as a reduction of occupancy expense.

 

    At December 28, 2007, future noncancellable minimum rental
    commitments under leases with remaining terms exceeding one
    year, including lease payments to the limited partnerships
    discussed above are as follows:

Guarantees


    Merrill Lynch issues various guarantees to counterparties in
    connection with certain leasing, securitization and other
    transactions. In addition, Merrill Lynch enters into certain
    derivative contracts that meet the accounting definition of a
    guarantee under FASB Interpretation No. 45,
    Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
    Guarantees, Including Indebtedness of Others
    (FIN 45). FIN 45 defines guarantees to
    include derivative contracts that contingently require a
    guarantor to make payment to a guaranteed party based on changes
    in an underlying (such as changes in the value of interest
    rates, security prices, currency rates, commodity prices,
    indices, etc.), that relate to an asset, liability or equity
    security of a guaranteed party. Derivatives that meet the
    FIN 45 definition of guarantees include certain written
    options and credit default swaps (contracts that require Merrill
    Lynch to pay the counterparty the par value of a referenced
    security if that referenced security defaults). Merrill Lynch
    does not track, for accounting purposes, whether its clients
    enter into these derivative contracts for speculative or hedging
    purposes. Accordingly, Merrill Lynch has disclosed information
    about all credit default swaps and certain types of written
    options that can potentially be used by clients to protect
    against changes in an underlying, regardless of how the
    contracts are used by the client. These guarantees and their
    expiration at December 28, 2007 are summarized as follows:

Derivative
    Contracts


    For certain derivative contracts, such as written interest rate
    caps and written currency options, the maximum payout could
    theoretically be unlimited, because, for example, the rise in
    interest rates or changes in foreign exchange rates could
    theoretically be unlimited. In addition, Merrill Lynch does not
    monitor its exposure to derivatives based on the theoretical
    maximum payout because that measure does not take into
    consideration the probability of the occurrence. As such, rather
    than including the maximum payout, the notional value of these
    contracts has been included to provide information about the
    magnitude of involvement with these types of contracts. However,
    it should be noted that the notional value is not a reliable
    indicator of Merrill Lynchs exposure to these contracts.

 

    Merrill Lynch records all derivative transactions at fair value
    on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. As previously noted, Merrill
    Lynch does not monitor its exposure to derivative contracts in
    terms of maximum payout. Instead, a risk framework is used to
    define risk tolerances and establish limits to help to ensure
    that certain risk-related losses occur within acceptable,
    predefined limits. Merrill Lynch economically hedges its
    exposure to these contracts by entering into a variety of
    offsetting derivative contracts and security positions. See the
    Derivatives section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for further discussion of risk management of
    derivatives.

 

    Merrill Lynch also funds selected assets, including CDOs and
    CLOs, via derivative contracts with third party structures that
    are not consolidated on its balance sheet. Of the total notional
    amount of these total return swaps, approximately
    $24 billion is term financed through facilities provided by
    commercial banks, $35 billion of long term funding is
    provided by third party special purpose vehicles and
    $11 billion is financed with asset backed commercial paper
    conduits. In certain circumstances, Merrill Lynch may be
    required to purchase these assets which would not result in
    additional gain or loss to the firm as such exposure is already
    reflected in the fair value of our derivative contracts.

 

Liquidity, Credit
    and Default Facilities


    The liquidity, credit and default facilities in the above table
    relate primarily to municipal bond securitization SPEs and
    asset-backed commercial paper conduits (Conduits).

 

    Merrill Lynch acts as liquidity provider to certain municipal
    bond securitization SPEs and provides both liquidity and credit
    default protection to certain other municipal bond
    securitization SPEs. As of December 28, 2007, the value of
    the assets held by the SPEs plus any additional collateral
    pledged to Merrill Lynch exceeded the amount of beneficial
    interests issued, which provides additional support to Merrill
    Lynch in the event that the standby facilities are drawn. In
    certain of these facilities, Merrill Lynch is generally required
    to provideliquidity support within seven days, while the
    remainder have third-party liquidity support for between 30 and
    364 days before

Table of Contents


    Merrill Lynch is required to provide liquidity. A significant
    portion of the facilities where Merrill Lynch is required to
    provide liquidity support within seven days are net
    liquidity facilities where upon draw Merrill Lynch may
    direct the trustee for the SPE to collapse the SPE trusts and
    liquidate the municipal bonds, and Merrill Lynch would only be
    required to fund any difference between par and the sale price
    of the bonds. Gross liquidity facilities require
    Merrill Lynch to wait up to 30 days before directing the
    trustee to liquidate the municipal bonds. During the second half
    of 2007, Merrill Lynch began reducing facilities that require
    liquidity in seven days, and the total amount of such facilities
    was $32.5 billion as of December 28, 2007, down from
    $40.7 billion as of June 29, 2007. Details of these
    liquidity and credit default facilities as of December 28,
    2007, are illustrated in the table below:

    In addition, Merrill Lynch, through a U.S. bank subsidiary
    has either provided or provides liquidity and credit facilities
    to three Conduits. The assets in these Conduits included loans
    and asset-backed securities. In the event of a disruption in the
    commercial paper market, the Conduits may draw upon their
    liquidity facilities and sell certain assets held by the
    respective Conduits to Merrill Lynch, thereby protecting
    commercial paper holders against certain changes in the fair
    value of the assets held by the Conduits. The credit facilities
    protect commercial paper investors against credit losses for up
    to a certain percentage of the portfolio of assets held by the
    respective Conduits.

 






     

    During the fourth quarter of 2007, Merrill Lynch purchased the
    remaining assets of one of the Conduits through the exercise of
    its liquidity facility and as a result the facility is no longer
    outstanding. Merrill Lynch does not have any remaining exposure
    to this Conduit as it is inactive. Although not legally
    terminated, Merrill Lynch does not anticipate utilizing this
    Conduit for off-balance-sheet financing in the future.


 

     

    As a result of a reconsideration event under FIN 46R in the
    fourth quarter of 2007, Merrill Lynch became the primary
    beneficiary for another Conduit. As a result, the Conduit was
    consolidated by Merrill Lynch and the facility is not considered
    outstanding.


 

     

    The outstanding amount of the facilities, or Merrill
    Lynchs maximum exposure, related to the remaining Conduit
    is approximately $1.2 billion as of December 28, 2007.
    The assets remaining in the Conduit are primarily auto and
    equipment loans and lease receivables totaling $0.9 billion
    (which approximates their fair value) with unfunded loan
    commitments for $250 million. The outstanding facility
    amount is net of $1.4 billion of assets that Merrill Lynch
    purchased during 2007. In addition, Merrill Lynch periodically
    purchased commercial paper from this Conduit, but did not hold
    any commercial paper as of December 28, 2007 and is under
    no obligation to purchase additional commercial paper. These
    liquidity and credit facilities are recorded off-balance sheet,
    unless a liability is deemed necessary when a contingent payment
    is deemed probable and estimable.



 

    Refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for more information on Conduits.

 

Residual Value
    Guarantees


    The amounts in the above table include residual value guarantees
    associated with the Hopewell campus and aircraft leases of
    $322 million at December 28, 2007.

 

Stand-by Letters
    of Credit and Other Guarantees


    Merrill Lynch provides guarantees to counterparties in the form
    of standby letters of credit in the amount of $2.6 billion.
    At December 28, 2007 Merrill Lynch held marketable
    securities of $593 million as collateral to secure these
    guarantees and a liability of $12 million was recorded on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 

    Further, in conjunction with certain principal-protected mutual
    funds, Merrill Lynch guarantees the return of the initial
    principal investment at the termination date of the fund. At
    December 28, 2007, Merrill Lynchs maximum potential
    exposure to loss with respect to these guarantees is
    $430 million assuming that the funds are invested
    exclusively in other general investments (i.e., the funds hold
    no risk-free assets), and that those other general investments
    suffer a total loss. As such, this measure significantly
    overstates Merrill Lynchs exposure or expected loss at
    December 28, 2007. These transactions met the
    SFAS No. 133 definition of derivatives and, as such,
    were carried as a liability with a fair value of approximately
    $7 million at December 28, 2007.





  
  
  
  
  




    Merrill Lynch 2007 Annual Report

Table of Contents


    Merrill Lynch also provides indemnifications related to the
    U.S. tax treatment of certain foreign tax planning
    transactions. The maximum exposure to loss associated with these
    transactions at December 28, 2007 is $167 million;
    however, Merrill Lynch believes that the likelihood of loss with
    respect to these arrangements is remote, and therefore has not
    recorded any liabilities in respect of these guarantees.

 

    In connection with residential mortgage loan and other
    securitization transactions, Merrill Lynch typically makes
    representations and warranties about the underlying assets. If
    there is a material breach of such representations and
    warranties, Merrill Lynch may have an obligation to repurchase
    the assets or indemnify the purchaser against any loss. For
    residential mortgage loan and other securitizations, the maximum
    potential amount that could be required to be repurchased is the
    current outstanding asset balance. Specifically related to First
    Franklin activities, there is currently approximately
    $40 billion of outstanding loans that First Franklin sold
    in various asset sales and securitization transactions over the
    last 36 months. Merrill Lynch has recognized a liability of
    approximately $520 million at December 28, 2007
    arising from these residential mortgage sales and securitization
    transactions.

 

    In addition to the guarantees described above, Merrill Lynch
    also provides guarantees to securities clearinghouses and
    exchanges. Under the standard membership agreement, members are
    required to guarantee the performance of other members. Under
    the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its
    obligations to the clearinghouse, other members would be
    required to meet shortfalls. Merrill Lynchs liability
    under these arrangements is not quantifiable and could exceed
    the cash and securities it has posted as collateral. However,
    the potential for Merrill Lynch to be required to make payments
    under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability is
    carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these
    arrangements.

 

    In connection with its prime brokerage business, Merrill Lynch
    provides to counterparties guarantees of the performance of its
    prime brokerage clients. Under these arrangements, Merrill Lynch
    stands ready to meet the obligations of its customers with
    respect to securities transactions. If the customer fails to
    fulfill its obligation, Merrill Lynch must fulfill the
    customers obligation with the counterparty. Merrill Lynch
    is secured by the assets in the customers account as well
    as any proceeds received from the securities transaction entered
    into by Merrill Lynch on behalf of the customer. No contingent
    liability is carried in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for
    these transactions as the potential for Merrill Lynch to be
    required to make payments under these arrangements is remote.

 

    In connection with providing supplementary protection to its
    customers, MLPF&S holds insurance in excess of that
    furnished by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation
    (SIPC), and MLI holds insurance in excess of the
    protection provided by the United Kingdom Compensation Scheme
    (Financial Services Compensation Scheme, FSCS). The
    policy provides total combined coverage up to $600 million
    in the aggregate (including up to $1.9 million per customer
    for cash) for losses incurred by customers in excess of the SIPC
    and/or FSCS limits. ML & Co. provides full indemnity
    to the policy provider syndicate against any losses as a result
    of this agreement. No contingent liability is carried in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets for this indemnification as the
    potential for Merrill Lynch to be required to make payments
    under this agreement is remote.

 

    In connection with its securities clearing business, Merrill
    Lynch performs securities execution, clearance and settlement
    services on behalf of other broker-dealer clients for whom it
    commits to settle trades submitted for or by such clients, with
    the applicable clearinghouse; trades are submitted either
    individually, in groups or series or, if specific arrangements
    are made with a particular clearinghouse and client, all
    transactions with such clearing entity by such client. Merrill
    Lynchs liability under these arrangements is not
    quantifiable and could exceed any cash deposit made by a client.
    However, the potential for Merrill Lynch to be required to make
    unreimbursed payments under these arrangements is remote due to
    the contractual capital requirements associated with
    clients activity and the regular review of clients
    capital. Accordingly, no liability is carried in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets for these transactions.

 

    In connection with certain European mergers and acquisition
    transactions, Merrill Lynch, in its capacity as financial
    advisor, in some cases may be required by law to provide a
    guarantee that the acquiring entity has or can obtain or issue
    sufficient funds or securities to complete the transaction.
    These arrangements are short-term in nature, extending from the
    commencement of the offer through the termination or closing.
    Where guarantees are required or implied by law, Merrill Lynch
    engages in a credit review of the acquirer, obtains
    indemnification and requests other contractual protections where
    appropriate. Merrill Lynchs maximum liability equals the
    required funding for each transaction and varies throughout the
    year depending upon the size and number of open transactions.
    Based on the review procedures performed, management believes
    the likelihood of being required to pay under these arrangements
    is remote. Accordingly, no liability is recorded in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets for these transactions.

 

    In the course of its business, Merrill Lynch routinely
    indemnifies investors for certain taxes, including U.S. and
    foreign withholding taxes on interest and other payments made on
    securities, swaps and other derivatives. These additional
    payments would be required upon a change in law or
    interpretation thereof. Merrill Lynchs maximum exposure
    under these indemnifications is not quantifiable. Merrill Lynch
    believes that the potential for such an adverse change is
    remote. As such, no liability is recorded in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

   Note 12. Employee
    Benefit Plans




    Merrill Lynch provides pension and other postretirement benefits
    to its employees worldwide through defined contribution pension,
    defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. These
    plans vary based on the country and local practices. Merrill
    Lynch reserves the right to amend or terminate these plans at
    any time.

 

    Merrill Lynch accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in
    accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers
    Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 88,
    Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
    of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits.
    Its postretirement benefit plans are accounted for in
    accordance with SFAS No. 106, Employers
    Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions.
    Merrill Lynch discloses information regarding defined
    benefit pension and postretirement plans in accordance with
    SFAS No. 132R, Employers Disclosures about
    Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. Postemployment
    benefits are accounted for in accordance with
    SFAS No. 112, Employers Accounting for
    Postemployment Benefits.

 

    In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, which
    requires an employer to recognize the overfunded and underfunded
    status of its defined benefit pension and other postretirement
    plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan
    assets and the benefit obligation, as an asset or liability in
    its statement of financial condition. The benefit obligation is
    defined as the projected benefit obligation for pension plans
    and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for
    postretirement plans. Upon adoption, SFAS No. 158
    requires an entity to recognize previously unrecognized
    actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs within
    accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The
    final net minimum pension liability (MPL)
    adjustments are recognized prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 158. SFAS No. 158 also requires
    defined benefit plan assets and benefit obligations to be
    measured as of the date of the companys fiscal year end.
    Merrill Lynch has historically used a September 30 measurement
    date. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 158, Merrill
    Lynch will be required to change its measurement date to
    coincide with its fiscal year end. This provision of
    SFAS No. 158 will be effective for Merrill Lynch
    beginning with year end 2008. The following table illustrates
    the final net MPL adjustment and the incremental effect of
    the application of SFAS No. 158:

   Defined
    Contribution Pension Plans
    




    The U.S. defined contribution pension plans consist of the
    Retirement Accumulation Plan (RAP), the Employee
    Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), and the 401(k)
    Savings & Investment Plan (401(k)). The
    RAP and ESOP cover substantially all U.S. employees who
    have met the service requirement. There is no service
    requirement for employee deferrals in the 401(k). However, there
    is a service requirement for an employee to receive corporate
    contributions in the 401(k).

 

    Merrill Lynch established the RAP and the ESOP, collectively
    known as the Retirement Program, for the benefit of
    employees with a minimum of one year of service. A notional
    retirement account is maintained for each participant. The RAP
    contributions are employer-funded based on compensation and
    years of service. Merrill Lynch made a contribution of
    approximately $186 million to the Retirement Program in
    order to satisfy the 2007 contribution requirement. These
    contributions for 2006 and 2005 were $165 million and
    $149 million, respectively. Under the RAP, employees are
    given the opportunity to invest their retirement savings in a
    number of different investment alternatives including
    ML & Co. common stock. Under the ESOP, all retirement
    savings are invested in ML & Co. common stock, until
    employees have five years of service after which they have the
    ability to diversify. Merrill Lynch expects to make
    contributions of approximately $187 million in 2008.

 

    Merrill Lynch guarantees the debt of the ESOP. All dividends
    received by the ESOP on unallocated ESOP shares were used to pay
    down the note. The note matured on December 31, 2007 and
    all outstanding balances were paid.

 

    Merrill Lynch allocates ESOP shares of Merrill Lynch stock to
    all participants of the ESOP as principal from the ESOP loan is
    repaid. ESOP shares are considered to be either allocated
    (contributed to participants accounts), committed
    (scheduled to be contributed at a

    Employees can participate in the 401(k) by contributing, on a
    tax-deferred basis, or on an after-tax basis via Roth
    contributions beginning January 1, 2007, a certain
    percentage of their eligible compensation, up to 25%, but not
    more than the maximum annual amount allowed by law. Employees
    may also contribute up to 25% of eligible compensation in
    after-tax dollars up to an annual maximum of $10,000. Employees
    over the age of 50 may also make a
    catch-up
    contribution up to the maximum annual amount allowed by law.
    Employees are given the opportunity to invest their 401(k)
    contributions in a number of different investment alternatives
    including ML & Co. common stock. Merrill Lynchs
    contributions are made in cash and effective January 1,
    2007, are equal to 100% of the first 4% of each
    participants eligible compensation contributed to the
    401(k), up to a maximum of $3,000 annually for employees with
    eligible compensation of less than $300,000, and $2,000 for all
    others. Merrill Lynch makes contributions to the 401(k) on a pay
    period basis and expects to make contributions of approximately
    $99 million in 2008.

 

    Merrill Lynch also sponsors various
    non-U.S. defined
    contribution pension plans. The costs of benefits under the RAP,
    401(k), and
    non-U.S. plans
    are expensed during the related service period.

 










   Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans
    




    In 1988 Merrill Lynch purchased a group annuity contract that
    guarantees the payment of benefits vested under a
    U.S. defined benefit pension plan that was terminated (the
    U.S. Terminated Pension Plan) in accordance
    with the applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income
    Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). At year-end 2007 and
    2006, a substantial portion of the assets supporting the annuity
    contract were invested in U.S. Government and agencies
    securities. Merrill Lynch, under a supplemental agreement, may
    be responsible for, or benefit from, actual experience and
    investment performance of the annuity assets. Merrill Lynch
    expects to contribute $11 million under this agreement in
    2008. Merrill Lynch also maintains supplemental defined benefit
    pension plans (i.e., plans not subject to Title IV of
    ERISA) for certain U.S. participants. Merrill Lynch expects
    to pay $1 million of benefit payments to participants in
    the U.S. non-qualified pension plans in 2008.

 

    Employees of certain
    non-U.S. subsidiaries
    participate in various local defined benefit pension plans.
    These plans provide benefits that are generally based on years
    of credited service and a percentage of the employees
    eligible compensation during the final years of employment.
    Merrill Lynchs funding policy has been to contribute
    annually at least the amount necessary to satisfy local funding
    standards. Merrill Lynch currently expects to contribute
    $74 million to its
    non-U.S. pension
    plans in 2008.

 










   Postretirement
    Benefits Other Than Pensions
    




    Merrill Lynch provides health insurance benefits to retired
    employees under a plan that covers substantially all
    U.S. employees who have met age and service requirements.
    The health care coverage is contributory, with certain retiree
    contributions adjusted periodically. Non-contributory life
    insurance was offered to employees that had retired prior to
    February 1, 2000. The accounting for costs of health care
    benefits anticipates future changes in cost-sharing provisions.
    Merrill Lynch pays claims as incurred. Full-time employees of
    Merrill Lynch become eligible for these benefits upon attainment
    of age 55 and completion of ten years of service. Employees
    who turn age 65 after January 1, 2011 and are eligible
    for and elect supplemental retiree medical coverage will pay the
    full cost of coverage after age 65. Beginning
    January 1, 2006, newly hired employees and rehired
    employees will be offered retiree medical coverage, if they
    otherwise meet the eligibility requirement, but on a
    retiree-pay-all basis for coverage before and after age 65.
    Merrill Lynch also sponsors similar plans that provide health
    care benefits to retired employees of certain
    non-U.S. subsidiaries.
    As of December 28, 2007, none of these plans had been
    funded.

    pension plans in 2007 and primarily relates to the BlackRock
    merger in 2006.
    


 

    The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) for all
    defined benefit pension plans was $3,062 million and
    $3,310 million at September 30, 2007 and
    September 30, 2006, respectively.

 

    The projected benefit obligation (PBO), ABO and fair
    value of plan assets for pension plans with ABO and PBO in
    excess of plan assets as of September 30, 2007 and
    September 30, 2006 are presented in the tables below. These
    plans primarily represent U.S. supplemental plans not
    subject to ERISA or
    non-U.S. plans
    where funding strategies vary due to legal requirements and
    local practices.

    The estimated net loss for the defined benefit pension plans
    that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss
    into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is
    approximately $11 million. The estimated net gain and prior
    service credit for the postretirement plans that will be
    amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net
    periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is approximately
    $5 million and $6 million, respectively.

The U.S. plan was terminated
    in 1988 and thus does not incur service costs.
    



(2)
    


Effective 2006 Merrill Lynch
    modified the investment policy relating to the
    U.S. Terminated Pension Plan which increased the expected
    long-term rate of return on plan assets. The increase in the
    expected return on plan assets for the
    non-U.S. plans
    can primarily be attributed to the U.K. Pension Plan as a result
    of increased contributions, favorable actual investment returns
    and exchange rate movements.
    


 

    The net actuarial losses (gains) represent changes in the amount
    of either the projected benefit obligation or plan assets
    resulting from actual experience being different than that
    assumed and from changes in assumptions. Merrill Lynch amortizes
    net actuarial losses (gains) over the average future service
    periods of active participants to the extent that the loss or
    gain exceeds 10% of the greater of the PBO or the fair value of
    plan assets. This amount is recorded within net periodic benefit
    cost. The average future service periods for the U.K. defined
    benefit pension plan, the U.S. postretirement plan and the
    U.S. Terminated Pension Plan were 12 years,
    13 years, and 13 years, respectively. Accordingly, the
    expense to be recorded in fiscal year ending 2008 related to the
    U.K. defined benefit pension plan net actuarial loss is
    $12 million, while credits related to the
    U.S. postretirement plan and the U.S. Terminated Plan
    net actuarial gains to be recorded in fiscal year ending 2008
    are approximately $(4) million and $(2) million,
    respectively.

The healthcare cost trend rate is
    assumed to decrease gradually through 2013 and remain constant
    thereafter.
    


 










   Plan
    Assumptions
    




    The discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation for
    the U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans
    was developed by selecting the appropriate U.S. Treasury
    yield, and the related swap spread, consistent with the duration
    of the plans obligation. This yield was further adjusted
    to reference a Merrill Lynch specific Moodys Corporate Aa
    rating. The discount rate for the U.K. pension plan was selected
    by reference to the appropriate U.K. GILTS rate, and the related
    swap spread, consistent with the duration of the plans
    obligation. This yield was further adjusted to reference a
    Merrill Lynch specific Moodys Corporate Aa rating.

 

    The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects
    the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or
    to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the
    projected benefit obligation. The U.S. terminated pension
    plan, which represents approximately 64% of Merrill Lynchs
    total pension plan assets as of September 30, 2007, is
    solely invested in a group annuity contract which is currently
    100% invested in fixed income securities. The expected long-term
    rate of return on plan assets for the U.S. terminated
    pension plan is based on the U.S. Treasury strip plus
    50 basis points which reflects the current investment
    policy. The U.K. pension plan, which represents approximately
    29% of Merrill Lynchs total plan assets as of
    September 30, 2007, is currently invested in 57% equity
    securities, 9% debt securities, 6% real estate, and 28% other.
    The expected long-term rate of return on the U.K. pension plan
    assets was determined by Merrill Lynch and reflects estimates by
    the plan investment advisors of the expected returns on
    different asset classes held by the plan in light of prevailing
    economic conditions at the beginning of the fiscal year. At
    September 30, 2007, Merrill Lynch increased the discount
    rate used to determine the U.S. pension plan and
    postretirement benefit plan obligations to 6.0%. The expected
    rate of return for the U.S. pension plan assets was
    increased from 4.9% in 2006 to 5.3% for 2007, which reduced
    expense by $7 million. The discount rate at
    September 30, 2007 for the U.K. pension plan was increased
    from 5.0% in 2006 to 6.0% for 2007. The expected rate of return
    for the U.K. pension plan was unchanged.

 

    Although Merrill Lynchs pension and postretirement benefit
    plans can be sensitive to changes in the discount rate, it is
    expected that a 25 basis point rate reduction would not
    have a material impact on the U.S. plan expenses for 2008.
    This change would increase the U.K. pension plan expense for
    2008 by approximately $7 million. Also, such a change would
    increase the U.S. and U.K. plan obligations at
    September 30, 2007 by $46 million and
    $67 million, respectively. A 25 basis point decline in
    the expected rate of return for the U.S. pension plan and
    the U.K. pension plan would result in an expense increase for
    2008 of approximately $5 million and $3 million,
    respectively.

 

    The assumed health care cost trend rate has a significant effect
    on the amounts reported for the postretirement health care
    plans. A one percent change in the assumed healthcare cost trend
    rate would have the following effects:

   Investment
    Strategy and Asset Allocation
    




    The U.S. terminated pension plan asset portfolio is
    structured such that the asset maturities match the duration of
    the plans obligations. Consistent with the plan
    termination in 1988, the annuity contract and the supplemental
    agreement, the asset portfolios investment objective calls
    for a concentration in fixed income securities, the majority of
    which have an investment grade rating.

 

    The assets of the U.K. pension plan are invested prudently so
    that the benefits promised to members are provided, having
    regard to the nature and the duration of the plans
    liabilities. The current planned investment strategy was set
    following an asset-liability study and advice from the
    Trustees investment advisors. The asset allocation
    strategy selected is designed to achieve a higher return than
    the

    lowest risk strategy while maintaining a prudent approach to
    meeting the plans liabilities. For the U.K. pension plan,
    the target asset allocation is 40% equity, 10% debt, 5% real
    estate, 45% target return (included in the table below in the
    non-U.S. Other
    category). The target return is a dynamic asset allocation
    method designed to achieve a minimum level of return based on
    LIBOR through the use of cash, debt and equity instruments. The
    investment manager has discretion to allocate the portfolio
    amongst the respective asset classes in order to achieve the
    return. As a risk control measure, a series of interest rate and
    inflation risk swaps have been executed covering a target of 60%
    of the plans assets.

The U.S. defined benefit pension
    plan payments are primarily funded under the terminated plan
    annuity contract.
    



(2)
    


The U.K., Japan and Swiss pension
    plan payments represent about 65%, 6% and 8%, respectively, of
    the non-U.S.
    2008 expected defined benefit pension payments.

The U.S. postretirement plan
    payments, including the Medicare subsidy, represent
    approximately 94% of the total 2008 expected postretirement
    benefit payments.
    


 










   Postemployment
    Benefits
    




    Merrill Lynch provides certain postemployment benefits for
    employees on extended leave due to injury or illness and for
    terminated employees. Employees who are disabled due to
    non-work-related illness or injury are entitled to disability
    income, medical coverage, and life insurance. Merrill Lynch also
    provides severance benefits to terminated employees. In
    addition, Merrill Lynch is mandated by U.S. state and
    federal regulations to provide certain other postemployment
    benefits. Merrill Lynch funds these benefits through a
    combination of self-insured and insured plans.

 

    Merrill Lynch recognized $335 million, $424 million,
    and $226 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively, of
    postemployment benefits expense, which included severance costs
    for terminated employees of $323 million,
    $417 million, and $225 million in 2007, 2006, and
    2005, respectively.

 










   Note 13. Employee
    Incentive Plans




    Merrill Lynch adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R
    in the first quarter of 2006. See Note 1 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

 

    To align the interests of employees with those of stockholders,
    Merrill Lynch sponsors several employee compensation plans that
    provide eligible employees with stock or options to purchase
    stock. The total pre-tax compensation cost recognized in
    earnings for stock-based compensation plans for 2007 was
    $1.8 billion. Pre-tax compensation cost for 2006 was
    $3.1 billion (net of $18 million re-classified to
    discontinued operations), which includes approximately
    $1.8 billion associated with one-time, non-cash
    compensation expenses further described in Note 1 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Pre-tax compensation cost for
    2005 was $1.0 billion. Total related tax benefits
    recognized in earnings for share-based payment compensation
    plans for 2007, 2006, and 2005 were $669 million,
    $1.2 billion and $381 million, respectively. Total
    compensation cost recognized for share-based payments related to
    awards granted to retirement

Table of Contents


    eligible employees prior to adoption of SFAS No. 123R
    was $617 million. Merrill Lynch also sponsors deferred cash
    compensation plans and award programs for eligible employees.

 

    As of December 28, 2007, there was $2.2 billion of
    total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested
    share-based payment compensation arrangements. This cost is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
    2.2 years.

 

    Below is a description of our share-based payment compensation
    plans.

 










   Long-Term
    Incentive Compensation Plans (LTIC Plans), Employee
    Stock
       Compensation Plan (ESCP) and
    Equity Capital Accumulation Plan (ECAP)
    




    LTIC Plans, ESCP and ECAP provide for grants of equity and
    equity-related instruments to certain employees. LTIC Plans
    consist of the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan, a
    shareholder approved plan used for grants to executive officers,
    and the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan for Managers and
    Producers, a broad-based plan which was approved by the Board of
    Directors, but has not been shareholder approved. LTIC Plans
    provide for the issuance of Restricted Shares, Restricted Units,
    and Non-qualified Stock Options, as well as Incentive Stock
    Options, Performance Shares, Performance Units, Performance
    Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, and other securities of
    Merrill Lynch. ESCP, a broad-based plan approved by shareholders
    in 2003, provides for the issuance of Restricted Shares,
    Restricted Units, Non-qualified Stock Options and Stock
    Appreciation Rights. ECAP, a shareholder-approved plan, provides
    for the issuance of Restricted Shares, as well as Performance
    Shares. All plans under LTIC Plans, ESCP and ECAP may be
    satisfied using either treasury or newly issued shares. As of
    December 28, 2007, no instruments other than Restricted
    Shares, Restricted Units, Non-qualified Stock Options,
    Performance Options and Stock Appreciation Rights had been
    granted.

 










   Restricted
    Shares and Units
    




    Restricted Shares are shares of ML & Co. common stock
    carrying voting and dividend rights. A Restricted Unit is deemed
    equivalent in fair market value to one share of common stock.
    Substantially all awards are settled in shares of common stock.
    Recipients of Restricted Unit awards receive cash payments
    equivalent to dividends. Under these plans, such shares and
    units are restricted from sale, transfer, or assignment until
    the end of the restricted period. Such shares and units are
    subject to forfeiture during the vesting period for grants under
    LTIC Plans, or the restricted period for grants under ECAP.
    Restricted share and unit grants made in 2003 through 2005
    generally cliff vest in four years. Restricted share and unit
    grants made in 2007 and 2006 generally step vest in four years.
    In December 2007, Merrill Lynch modified the vesting schedule of
    certain previously granted stock bonus awards. As a result, all
    outstanding stock bonus awards held by employees other than
    current or former executive officers that were scheduled to vest
    on January 31, 2009, vested on January 31, 2008. The
    accelerated vesting resulted in approximately $181 million
    of compensation expense in fiscal year 2007 that would have been
    recognized in 2008 and 2009.

 

    In January 2007 and 2006, Participation Units were granted from
    the Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan under Merrill
    Lynchs Managing Partners Incentive Program. The awards
    granted under this program are fully at risk, and the potential
    payout varies depending on Merrill Lynchs financial
    performance against pre-determined return on average common
    stockholders equity (ROE) targets. One-third
    of the Participation Units converted into Restricted Shares on
    January 31, 2007. Based on Merrill Lynchs 2007
    performance, no participation units will convert on
    January 31, 2008. The remaining Participation Units will
    convert on January 31, 2009, subject to the satisfaction of
    minimum ROE targets determined for the 2008 fiscal year.
    Participation Units will cease to be outstanding immediately
    following conversion. If the minimum target is not met, the
    Participation Units will expire without being converted.

 

    In March 2007, Participation Units were granted from the
    Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan under Merrill Lynchs
    GMI Managing Partners Incentive Program. The awards granted
    under this program are fully at risk, and the potential payout
    varies depending on Merrill Lynchs financial performance
    against a pre-determined GMI year-over-year pre-tax profit
    growth target. Based on Merrill Lynchs 2007 performance,
    no participation units will convert on January 31, 2008.
    The remaining Participation Units will convert on
    January 31, 2009, subject to the satisfaction of a minimum
    pre-tax growth target determined for the 2008 fiscal year.
    Participation Units will cease to be outstanding immediately
    following conversion. If the minimum target is not met, the
    Participation Units will expire without being converted.

 

    In connection with the BlackRock merger, 1,564,808 Restricted
    Shares held by employees that transferred to BlackRock were
    converted to Restricted Units effective June 2, 2006. The
    vesting period for such awards was accelerated to end on the
    transaction closing date of September 29, 2006. In
    addition, the vesting periods for 1,135,477 Restricted Share and
    156,118 Restricted Unit awards that were not converted were
    accelerated to end on the transaction closing date of
    September 29, 2006.

    All Options and Stock Appreciation Rights outstanding as of
    December 28, 2007 are fully vested or expected to vest.

 

    At year-end 2007, the weighted-average remaining contractual
    terms of options outstanding and exercisable were
    3.38 years and 3.20 years, respectively.

 

    The weighted-average fair value of options granted in 2007,
    2006, and 2005 was $19.29, $18.46, and $18.04, per option,
    respectively.

 

    The fair value of option awards with vesting based solely on
    service requirements is estimated on the date of grant based on
    a Black-Scholes option pricing model using the following
    weighted-average assumptions. Expected volatilities are based on
    historical volatility of ML & Co. common stock. The
    expected term of options granted is equal to the contractual
    life of the options. The risk-free rate for periods within the
    contractual life of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
    The expected dividend is based on the current dividend rate at
    the time of grant.

    In 2007, option awards with vesting that is partially dependent
    on pre-determined increases in the price of Merrill Lynchs
    common stock were granted to certain senior executive employees.
    The fair value of these option awards is estimated on the date
    of grant based on a lattice option pricing model using the
    following weighted-average assumptions. Expected volatilities
    are based on historical volatility of ML & Co. common
    stock. The expected life of options granted is based on
    performance conditions relating to minimum stock price
    thresholds required for exercisability and assuming exercise
    when the stock price reaches a level equal to two times the
    exercise price. The risk-free rate for periods within the
    contractual life of the option is based on the
    U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.
    The expected dividend is based on the current dividend rate at
    the time of grant.

   Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP)
    




    ESPP, which are shareholder approved, allows eligible employees
    to invest from 1% to 10% of their eligible compensation to
    purchase ML & Co. common stock, subject to legal
    limits. For 2007, 2006, and 2005 the maximum annual purchase was
    $23,750. Purchases were made at a discount equal to 5% of the
    average high and low market price on the relevant investment
    date. Up to 125,000,000 shares of common stock have been
    authorized for issuance under ESPP. The activity in ESPP during
    2007, 2006, and 2005 follows:

    and $2.67 per right, respectively.

 










   Director
    Plans
    




    Merrill Lynch provides stock-based compensation to its
    non-employee directors under the Merrill Lynch & Co.,
    Inc. Deferred Stock Unit Plan for Non-Employee Directors, which
    was approved by shareholders in 2005 (New Directors
    Plan) and the Deferred Stock Unit and Stock Option Plan
    for Non-Employee Directors (Old Directors Plan)
    which was adopted by the Board of Directors in 1996 and
    discontinued after stockholders approved the New Directors Plan.
    In 2005, shareholders authorized Merrill Lynch to issue
    500,000 shares under the New Directors Plan and also
    authorized adding all shares that remained available for
    issuance under the Old Directors Plan to shares available under
    the New Directors Plan for a total of approximately
    1 million shares.

 

    Under both plans, non-employee directors are to receive deferred
    stock units, payable in shares of ML & Co. common
    stock after a deferral period of five years. Under the Old
    Directors Plan, 13,916 and 29,573 deferred stock units were
    outstanding at year-end 2007 and 2006, respectively. Under the
    New Directors Plan, 65,239 and 55,735 deferred stock units
    remained outstanding at year-end 2007 and 2006, respectively.

 

    Additionally, the Old Directors Plan provided for the grant of
    stock options which the New Directors Plan eliminated. There
    were approximately 110,961 and 121,051 stock options outstanding
    under the Old Directors Plan at year-end 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

 










   Book
    Value Plan
    




    Merrill Lynch also has instruments representing the right to
    receive 807,400 shares under Merrill Lynchs Investor
    Equity Purchase Plan (Book Value Plan). Issuances
    under the Book Value Plan were discontinued in 1995 and no
    further shares are authorized for issuance.

 










   Financial
    Advisor Capital Accumulation Award Plans (FACAAP)
    




    Under FACAAP, eligible employees in GWM are granted awards
    generally based upon their prior years performance.
    Payment for an award is contingent upon continued employment for
    a period of time and is subject to forfeiture during that
    period. Awards granted in 2003 and thereafter are generally
    payable eight years from the date of grant in a fixed number of
    shares of ML & Co. common stock. For outstanding
    awards granted prior to 2003, payment is generally made ten
    years from the date of grant in a fixed number of shares of
    ML & Co. common stock unless the fair market value of
    such shares is less than a specified minimum value, in which
    case the minimum value is paid in cash. Eligible participants
    may defer awards beyond the scheduled payment date. Only shares
    of common stock held as treasury stock may be issued under
    FACAAP. FACAAP, which was approved by the Board of Directors,
    has not been shareholder approved.

 

    At December 28, 2007, shares subject to outstanding awards
    totaled 33,740,269 while 12,694,124 shares were available
    for issuance through future awards. The weighted-average fair
    value of awards granted under FACAAP during 2007, 2006, and 2005
    was $83.30, $79.70, and $59.92 per award, respectively.

 










   Other
    Compensation Arrangements
    




    Merrill Lynch sponsors deferred compensation plans in which
    employees who meet certain minimum compensation thresholds may
    participate on either a voluntary or mandatory basis.
    Contributions to the plans are made on a tax-deferred basis by
    participants.

 

    Participants returns on these contributions may be indexed
    to various mutual funds and other funds, including certain
    company-sponsored investment vehicles that qualify as employee
    securities companies.

 

    Merrill Lynch also sponsors several cash-based employee award
    programs, under which certain employees are eligible to receive
    future cash compensation, generally upon fulfillment of the
    service and vesting criteria for the particular program.

 

    When appropriate, Merrill Lynch maintains various assets as an
    economic hedge of its liabilities to participants under the
    deferred compensation plans and award programs. These assets and
    the payables accrued by Merrill Lynch under the various plans
    and grants are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such
    assets totaled $2.2 billion and $2.5 billion at
    December 28, 2007 and

    December 29, 2006 respectively. Accrued liabilities at
    year-end 2007 and 2006 were $2.2 billion and
    $2.4 billion, respectively. Changes to deferred
    compensation liabilities and corresponding returns on the assets
    that economically hedge these liabilities are recorded within
    compensation and benefits expense on the Consolidated Statements
    of (Loss)/Earnings.

    The 2007, 2006 and 2005 effective tax rates reflect net benefits
    of $6 million, $496 million, and $156 million,
    respectively, related to changes in estimates or rates with
    respect to prior years, and settlements with various tax
    authorities. The 2005 tax rate also included $97 million of
    tax expense ($113 million tax expense recorded in the
    fourth quarter less $16 million tax benefit recorded in the
    second quarter) associated with the foreign earnings
    repatriation of $1.8 billion.

 

    Deferred income taxes are provided for the effects of temporary
    differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and
    its reported amount in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These
    temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in
    future years. In addition, deferred taxes are recognized with
    respect to losses and credits that have been generated for tax
    purposes that will be recognized in future periods. At
    December 28, 2007, Merrill Lynch had U.S. net
    operating loss carryforwards of approximately $2.7 billion,
    U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $543 million and
    United Kingdom loss carryforwards of $13.5 billion. The
    U.S. losses are primarily state carryforwards expiring in
    various years from 2008 through 2027, while the U.S. foreign tax
    credit carryfowards expire in 2017. The United Kingdom loss has
    an unlimited carryforward period and a tax benefit has been
    recognized for the deferred tax asset with no valuation
    allowance. In addition, Merrill Lynch had approximately
    $31 million of state tax credit carryforwards expiring in
    various years after 2007.

    Merrill Lynch adopted FIN 48 effective the beginning of the
    first quarter of 2007 and recognized a decrease to beginning
    retained earnings and an increase to the liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits of approximately $66 million.

 

    A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

    Of the above balance at the end of the year, approximately

    competent authority and foreign tax credit offsets) represents
    the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized,
    would favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods.
    Merrill Lynch paid an assessment to Japan in 2005 for the fiscal
    years April 1, 1998 through March 31, 2003, in
    relation to the taxation of income that was originally reported
    in other jurisdictions. During the third quarter of 2005,
    Merrill Lynch started the process of obtaining clarification
    from international tax authorities on the appropriate allocation
    of income among multiple jurisdictions to prevent double
    taxation. In addition, Merrill Lynch filed briefs with the
    U.S. Tax Court in 2005 with respect to a tax case, which
    had been remanded for further proceedings in accordance with a
    2004 opinion of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
    Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the initial
    adverse opinion of the U.S. Tax Court rendered in 2003
    against Merrill Lynch, with respect to a 1987 transaction, but
    remanded the case to the U.S. Tax Court to consider a new
    argument. The U.S. Tax Court has not issued a decision on
    this remanded matter, and it is uncertain as to when a decision
    will be rendered. The unrecognized tax benefits with respect to
    this case and the Japanese assessment, while paid, have been
    included in the $1.5 billion and the $1.2 billion
    amounts above.

    Merrill Lynch recognizes the accrual of interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. For
    the years 2007, 2006 and 2005, Merrill Lynch recognized net
    expense (benefit) of approximately $64 million,
    $(21) million and $(8) million in interest and
    penalties. Merrill Lynch had approximately $156 million and
    $36 million (net of $71 million interest receivable
    relating to a carryback claim) for the payment of interest and
    penalties accrued at December 28, 2007 and
    December 29, 2006, respectively.

 

    Merrill Lynch is under examination by the Internal Revenue
    Service (IRS) and other tax authorities in countries
    including Japan and the United Kingdom, and states in which
    Merrill Lynch has significant business operations, such as New
    York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction.

 

    Below is a table of tax years that remain subject to examination
    by major tax jurisdiction:

    The IRS audits for the years
    20042006
    may be completed in 2008. It is also reasonably possible that
    audits in other countries and states may conclude in 2008. In
    2008, Merrill Lynch may obtain clarification from international
    tax authorities on the appropriate allocation of income among
    multiple jurisdictions (transfer pricing) to prevent double
    taxation resulting from the tax assessment paid to Japan in
    2005. While it is reasonably possible that a significant
    reduction in unrecognized tax benefits may occur within
    12 months of December 28, 2007, quantification of an
    estimated range cannot be made at this time due to the
    uncertainty of the potential outcome of outstanding issues.

 

    Income tax benefits of $641 million, $501 million, and
    $317 million were allocated to stockholders equity
    related to employee stock compensation transactions for 2007,
    2006, and 2005, respectively.

 

    Cumulative undistributed earnings of
    non-U.S. subsidiaries
    were approximately $13.0 billion at December 28, 2007.
    No deferred U.S. federal income taxes have been provided
    for the undistributed earnings to the extent that they are
    permanently reinvested in Merrill Lynchs
    non-U.S. operations.
    It is not practical to determine the amount of additional tax
    that may be payable in the event these earnings are repatriated.

 










   Note 15. Regulatory
    Requirements




    Effective January 1, 2005, Merrill Lynch became a
    consolidated supervised entity (CSE) as defined by
    the SEC. As a CSE, Merrill Lynch is subject to group-wide
    supervision, which requires Merrill Lynch to compute allowable
    capital and risk allowances on a consolidated basis. At
    December 28, 2007 Merrill Lynch was in compliance with
    applicable CSE standards.

 

    Certain U.S. and
    non-U.S. subsidiaries
    are subject to various securities and banking regulations and
    capital adequacy requirements promulgated by the regulatory and
    exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate.
    These regulatory restrictions may impose regulatory capital
    requirements and limit the amounts that these subsidiaries can
    pay in dividends or advance to Merrill Lynch. Merrill
    Lynchs principal regulated subsidiaries are discussed
    below.

 










   Securities
    Regulation
    




    As a registered broker-dealer, Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
    Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S)
    is subject to the net capital requirements of
    Rule 15c3-1
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
    Rule). Under the alternative method permitted by the Rule,
    the minimum required net capital, as defined, shall be the
    greater of 2% of aggregate debit items (ADI) arising
    from customer transactions or $500 million. At
    December 28, 2007, MLPF&Ss regulatory net
    capital of $3,830 million was approximately 14.5% of ADI,
    and its regulatory net capital in excess of the SEC minimum
    required was $3,266 million.

 

    As a futures commission merchant, MLPF&S is also subject to
    the capital requirements of the Commodity Futures Trading
    Commission (CFTC), which requires that minimum net
    capital should not be less than 8% of the total customer risk
    margin requirement plus 4% of the total non-customer risk margin
    requirement. MLPF&S regulatory net capital of
    $3,830 million exceeded the CFTC minimum requirement of
    $600 million by $3,230 million.

    Merrill Lynch International (MLI), a U.K. regulated
    investment firm, is subject to capital requirements of the
    Financial Services Authority (FSA). Financial

    Merrill Lynch Government Securities Inc. (MLGSI), a
    primary dealer in U.S. Government securities, is subject to
    the capital adequacy requirements of the Government Securities
    Act of 1986. This rule requires dealers to maintain liquid
    capital in excess of market and credit risk, as defined, by 20%
    (a 1.2-to-1 capital-to-risk standard). At December 28,
    2007, MLGSIs liquid capital of $1,911 million was
    256.0% of its total market and credit risk, and liquid capital
    in excess of the minimum required was $1,016 million.

 

    Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co. Ltd. (MLJS), a

    $1,729 million, exceeding the minimum requirement by
    $823 million.

 










   Banking
    Regulation
    




    Merrill Lynch Bank USA (MLBUSA) is a Utah-chartered
    industrial bank, regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance
    Corporation (FDIC) and the State of Utah Department
    of Financial Institutions (UTDFI). Merrill Lynch
    Bank & Trust Co., FSB (MLBT-FSB) is a
    full service thrift institution regulated by the Office of
    Thrift Supervision (OTS), whose deposits are insured
    by the FDIC. Both MLBUSA and MLBT-FSB are required to maintain
    capital levels that at least equal minimum capital levels
    specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to
    meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory, and
    possibly additional discretionary, actions by the regulators
    that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the
    banks. The following table illustrates the actual capital ratios
    and capital amounts for MLBUSA and MLBT-FSB as of
    December 28, 2007.

    As a result of its ownership of MLBT-FSB, ML & Co. is
    registered with the OTS as a savings and loan holding company
    (SLHC) and subject to regulation and examination by
    the OTS as a SLHC. ML & Co. is classified as a unitary
    SLHC, and will continue to be so classified as long as it and
    MLBT-FSB continue to comply with certain conditions. Unitary
    SLHCs are exempt from the material restrictions imposed upon the
    activities of SLHCs that are not unitary SLHCs. SLHCs other than
    unitary SLHCs are generally prohibited from engaging in
    activities other than conducting business as a savings
    association, managing or controlling savings associations,
    providing services to subsidiaries or engaging in activities
    permissible for bank holding companies. Should ML &
    Co. fail to continue to qualify as a unitary SLHC, in order to
    continue its present businesses that would not be permissible
    for a SLHC, ML & Co. could be required to divest
    control of MLBT-FSB.

 

    Merrill Lynch International Bank Limited (MLIB), an
    Ireland-based regulated bank, is subject to the capital
    requirements of the Financial Regulator of Ireland. MLIB is
    required to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements under
    the European Union (EU) banking law as implemented
    in Ireland by the Financial Regulator. At December 28,
    2007, MLIBs capital ratio was above the minimum
    requirement at 11.1% and its financial resources were
    $10,382 million, exceeding the minimum requirement by
    $1,014 million.

 










   Note 16. Acquisitions




    On December 30, 2006, Merrill Lynch acquired the First
    Franklin mortgage origination franchise and related servicing
    platform from National City Corporation for $1.3 billion.
    First Franklin originates residential mortgage loans through a
    wholesale network and retail channel branded as NationPoint. The
    results of operations of First Franklin are included in GMI.

 

    On September 21, 2007, Merrill Lynch acquired all of the
    outstanding common shares of First Republic in exchange for a
    combination of cash and stock for a total transaction value of
    $1.8 billion. First Republic provides personalized,
    relationship-based banking services, including private banking,
    private business banking, real estate lending, trust, brokerage
    and investment management. The results of operations of First
    Republic are included in GWM. In conjunction with the
    acquisition of First Republic, Merrill Lynch issued
    $65 million of 6.70% non-cumulative perpetual preferred
    stock and $50 million of 6.25% non-cumulative preferred
    stock in exchange for First Republic Banks preferred stock
    Series A and B, respectively. Upon closing the First
    Republic acquisition, Merrill Lynch also issued
    11.6 million shares of common stock, par value
    $1.331/3
    per share, as consideration.

   Note 17. Discontinued
    Operations




    On August 13, 2007, Merrill Lynch announced that it will
    form a strategic business relationship with AEGON in the areas
    of insurance and investment products. As part of this
    relationship, Merrill Lynch had agreed to sell MLIG to AEGON for
    $1.3 billion. Merrill Lynch will continue to serve the
    insurance needs of its clients through its core distribution and
    advisory capabilities. The sale of MLIG was completed in the
    fourth quarter of 2007 and resulted in an after-tax gain of
    $316 million. The gain along with the financial results of
    MLIG, have been reported within discontinued operations for all
    periods presented and the assets and liabilities were not
    considered material for separate presentation. Merrill Lynch
    previously reported the results of MLIG in the GWM business
    segment.

 

    On December 24, 2007 Merrill Lynch announced that it had
    reached an agreement with GE Capital to sell Merrill Lynch
    Capital, a wholly-owned middle-market commercial finance
    business. The sale includes substantially all off Merrill Lynch
    Capitals operations, including its commercial real estate
    division. This transaction closed on February 4, 2008.
    Merrill Lynch has included results of Merrill Lynch Capital
    within discontinued operations for all periods presented and the
    assets and liabilities were not considered material for separate
    presentation. Merrill Lynch previously reported results of
    Merrill Lynch Capital in the GMI business segment.

   Note 18. BlackRock
    Merger




    On September 29, 2006, Merrill Lynch completed the merger
    of its MLIM business with BlackRock. In connection with the
    BlackRock merger, Merrill Lynch received 65 million
    BlackRock common and preferred shares and owns a 45% voting
    interest and approximately half of the economic interest of the
    combined company. At the completion of the BlackRock merger,
    Merrill Lynch recognized a pre-tax gain of $2.0 billion,
    along with related non-interest expenses of $202 million
    for a total after-tax net benefit of $1.1 billion. Merrill
    Lynchs investment in BlackRock is included in investment
    securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and has been
    included in the GWM segment subsequent to the merger.
    Additionally, in connection with the BlackRock merger, the
    goodwill associated with the MLIM business was derecognized on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 29, 2006.
    Merrill Lynch accounts for its investment in BlackRock under the
    equity method of accounting and records its share of
    BlackRocks earnings, net of expenses and taxes, in
    earnings from equity method investments on the Consolidated
    Statements of (Loss)/Earnings.

   Note 19. Subsequent
    Events



 

Mandatory
    Convertible Preferred


    On January 15, 2008, Merrill Lynch reached separate
    agreements with several long-term investors, primarily Korea
    Investment Corporation, Kuwait Investment Authority and Mizuho
    Corporate Bank, to sell an aggregate of 66,000 shares of
    newly issued 9.00% Non-Voting Mandatory Convertible
    Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1, par value $1.00
    per share and liquidation preference $100,000 per share (the
    Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock), at a price
    of $100,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of
    approximately $6.6 billion. The shares of Mandatory
    Convertible Preferred Stock were issued on various dates between
    January 17, 2008 and February 1, 2008.

 

Common
    Stock


    On December 24, 2007, Merrill Lynch reached agreements with
    each of Temasek Capital (Private) Limited (Temasek)
    and Davis Selected Advisors LP (Davis) to sell an
    aggregate of 116.7 million shares of newly issued common
    stock, par value
    $1.331/3 per
    share, at $48.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of
    approximately $5.6 billion.

 

    Davis purchased 25 million shares of Merrill Lynch common
    stock on December 27, 2007 at a price per share of $48.00,
    or an aggregate purchase price of $1.2 billion. Temasek
    purchased 55 million shares on December 28, 2007 and
    the remaining 36.7 million shares on January 11, 2008.
    In addition, Merrill Lynch granted Temasek an option to purchase
    an additional 12.5 million shares of common stock under
    certain circumstances. This option was exercised, with
    2.8 million shares issued on February 1, 2008 and
    9.7 million shares issued on February 5, 2008, in each
    case at a purchase price of $48.00 per share for an aggregate
    purchase price of $600 million.

 










   Note 20. Cash
    Flow Restatement



 

    Subsequent to the issuance of the Companys Consolidated
    Financial Statements for the year ended December 29, 2006,
    the Company determined that its previously issued Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended
    December 29, 2006 and December 30, 2005 contained an
    error resulting from the reclassification of certain cash flows
    from trading liabilities into derivative financing transactions.
    This error resulted in an overstatement of cash used for
    operating activities and a corresponding overstatement of cash
    provided by financing activities for the periods described above.

 

    These adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
    do not affect the Companys Consolidated Statements of
    (Loss)/Earnings, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated
    Statement of Changes in Stockholders Equity, Consolidated
    Statements of Comprehensive (Loss)/Income, or cash and cash
    equivalents. These adjustments also do not affect the
    Companys compliance with any financial covenants under its
    borrowing facilities.

 

    A summary presentation of this cash flow restatement for the
    years ended December 29, 2006 and December 30, 2005 is
    presented below.

    The previously issued Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows for the 2007 and 2006 fiscal quarters contained an
    overstatement of cash used for operating activities and a
    corresponding overstatement of cash provided by financing
    activities which resulted from the reclassification of certain
    cash flows from trading liabilities into derivative financing
    transactions. The Company will restate its interim Condensed
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three- six- and
    nine-month periods ended March 30, 2007, June 29, 2007
    and September 28, 2007. The following is a summary of the
    effects of these changes on the Companys unaudited
    Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal
    2007 and 2006 quarters.

    Additional legislation and regulations, and changes in rules
    promulgated by the SEC or other U.S. federal and state
    government regulatory authorities and self-regulatory
    organizations and by
    non-U.S. government
    regulatory agencies may directly affect the manner of our
    operation and profitability. Certain of our operations are
    subject to compliance with privacy regulations enacted by the
    U.S. federal and state governments, the EU, other
    jurisdictions
    and/or
    enacted by the various self-regulatory organizations or
    exchanges. New laws or regulations or changes to existing laws
    either in the U.S. or in other jurisdictions where we conduct
    business could adversely affect us. As we expand into new
    regions we are subject to different regulatory regimes which
    impose additional complexities, compliance requirements and
    costs.

 

    ML & Co. and certain U.S. and
    non-U.S. regulated
    subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements.
    Many of the principal regulators for these legal entities either
    have revised or are in the process of revising their capital
    requirements to be consistent with the Basel II capital
    standards issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.
    ML & Co. has adopted the Basel II capital
    standards and as of January 1, 2008, MLI, MLIB and our
    other regulated European subsidiaries also implemented the
    Basel II capital standards. We continue to address
    implementation of these revised regulatory capital requirements
    for other relevant subsidiaries, as required. We are investing
    in enhancements to our measurement and reporting systems to
    support effective implementation across the firm.

 










   United
    States Regulatory Oversight and Supervision
    



 

Holding Company
    Supervision


    In June 2004, the SEC approved the Consolidated Supervised
    Entity rule that created a voluntary framework for comprehensive
    group-wide risk management procedures and consolidated
    supervision of certain financial services holding companies by
    the SEC. We are a consolidated supervised entity subject to
    group-wide supervision by the SEC and capital requirements
    generally consistent with the standards of the Basel Committee
    on Banking Supervision. As such, we are computing allowable
    capital and risk allowances consistent with Basel II
    capital standards; permitting the SEC to examine the books and
    records of ML & Co. and any affiliate that does not
    have a principal regulator; and have adopted various additional
    SEC reporting, record-keeping, and notification requirements.

 

Broker-Dealer
    Regulation


    MLPF&S, Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp. (ML
    Pro) and certain other subsidiaries of ML & Co.
    are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and, as such, are
    subject to regulation by the SEC and by self-regulatory
    organizations, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory
    Authority (FINRA). Certain Merrill Lynch
    subsidiaries and affiliates, including MLPF&S, are
    registered as investment advisers with the SEC.

 

    The Merrill Lynch entities that are broker-dealers registered
    with the SEC are subject to
    Rule 15c3-1
    under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange
    Act) which is designed to measure the general financial
    condition and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Under this rule,
    these entities are required to maintain the minimum net capital
    deemed necessary to meet broker-dealers continuing
    commitments to customers and others. Under certain
    circumstances, this rule limits the ability of such
    broker-dealers to allow withdrawal of such capital by
    ML & Co. or other Merrill Lynch subsidiaries.
    Additional information regarding certain net capital
    requirements is set forth in Note 15 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

 

Sarbanes-Oxley
    and Related Rules


    Aspects of our public disclosure, corporate governance
    principles and the roles of auditors and counsel are subject to
    the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) and
    certain related regulations and rules proposed
    and/or
    adopted by the SEC, the NYSE and other self-regulatory
    organizations. Sarbanes-Oxley requirements include requiring our
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to certify
    that our financial information is fairly presented and fully
    complies with disclosure requirements. Additionally, they must
    evaluate

Table of Contents


    the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and
    disclose the results of their evaluation. Additional areas of
    focus as a result of Sarbanes-Oxley include: disclosures of off
    balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations;
    managements assessment of internal controls and procedures
    for financial reporting; the adoption of a code of ethics for
    the Chief Executive Officer and senior financial and accounting
    officers; and disclosure of whether the Audit Committee of the
    Board of Directors includes an Audit Committee financial expert.
    Related FINRA and other self-regulatory organization rules
    require that our Chief Executive Officer certify compliance with
    applicable corporate governance standards. These rules also
    require listed companies to, among other items, adopt corporate
    governance guidelines and a code of business conduct, tighten
    applicable criteria for determining director and audit committee
    member independence, and increase the authority and
    responsibilities of the Audit Committee.

 

Research Related
    Regulation


    Over the previous several years, the research function at
    integrated broker-dealers has been the subject of substantial
    regulatory and media attention. As a result of regulatory and
    legal mandates as well as firm initiatives, we enacted a number
    of new policies to enhance the quality of our research product
    including: modifying the compensation system for research
    analysts; forming a Research Recommendations Committee to review
    equity analysts investment recommendations; adopting a new
    simplified securities rating system; implementing new policies
    and procedures to comply with all legal requirements, including
    those limiting communications between equity research analysts
    and investment banking and other origination personnel; and
    adding additional disclosures on research reports regarding
    potential conflicts of interest. We also appointed an
    independent consultant who identified independent third-party
    research providers to provide fundamental research on certain
    companies that we cover. This research has been made available
    to our clients in the United States beginning in July 2004 in
    accordance with legal requirements. Under the terms of the
    global research settlement, in 2005 we appointed an independent
    monitor who reported on our compliance with the terms of the
    settlement. Upon the fifth anniversary of the global settlement,
    October 31, 2008, the settling firms, including Merrill
    Lynch, are required to certify their compliance with the terms
    of the global settlement and are permitted to request relief
    from its terms.

 

    The compensation system for research analysts includes an
    evaluation of the performance of analysts recommendations,
    including the extent to which the analysts insights and
    recommendations have benefited investors. The compensation of
    all analysts responsible for the substance of an equity research
    report is required to be reviewed and approved by a committee
    reporting to the Board of Directors of MLPF&S. The
    Management Development and Compensation Committee of the
    ML & Co. Board of Directors, a Committee consisting
    entirely of independent directors, is also required to review
    this compensation process for consistency with certain legal
    requirements. The Audit Committee of the ML & Co.
    Board of Directors is required to review the budget and expense
    allocation process for research for consistency with the terms
    of the global research settlement. Our Investment Banking Group
    has no input into research analyst compensation or the research
    budget.

 

    FINRA continues to consider and propose changes to regulations
    relating to equity research and amendments to their rules are
    expected to be adopted in 2008. Research activities also remain
    a focus of securities regulators rulemaking outside the
    U.S.

 

Client
    Information Regulation


    We are subject to extensive anti-money laundering regulation in
    the United States and other jurisdictions. In the United States,
    our broker-dealers and banking subsidiaries are subject to the
    USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act). The
    Patriot Act was designed to promote the identification of
    parties that may be involved in terrorist activities, money
    laundering or other suspicious activities. To that end, it
    contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws
    and has mandated the implementation of various new regulations
    applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services
    companies, including so-called know your customer
    rules, which set standards for verifying client identification
    at account opening, and obligations to monitor client
    transactions and report suspicious activities. Anti-money
    laundering laws outside the United States contain similar
    provisions.

 

    Our obligations to verify client identity, to monitor and report
    suspicious transactions, and to respond to requests for
    information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement
    agencies, and to share information with other financial
    institutions, has required the implementation and
    maintenance of internal practices, including specialized
    employee training programs, procedures and controls. These
    practices, procedures and controls have increased, and may
    continue to increase, our costs, and any failure with respect to
    our programs in this area could subject us to substantial
    liability and regulatory fines.

 

Additional
    Regulation of Certain U.S. Entities


    MLPF&S and ML Pro are registered futures commission
    merchants and, as such, are regulated by the CFTC and the
    National Futures Association (NFA). The CFTC and the
    NFA impose net capital requirements on these companies. In
    addition, these companies are subject to the rules of the
    futures exchanges and clearing associations of which they are
    members.

 

    Merrill Lynch Commodities, Inc. (MLCI) is subject to
    regulation by the FERC, CFTC and other agencies with respect to
    certain aspects of its activities. MLCI is also a member of the
    New York Mercantile Exchange and is subject to its rules.

    regulatory bodies. Certain Merrill Lynch subsidiaries are

    activities outside the United States are regulated by various
    government entities in the particular jurisdiction where they

    and/or
    conduct their business activities. In some cases, the
    legislative and regulatory developments outside the
    U.S. applicable to these subsidiaries may have a global
    impact.

 

    On November 1, 2007, countries in the European Union
    implemented the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive
    (MiFID) marking a significant change in the
    regulation of the European investment industry. The main
    objective of MiFID is to enhance the development of a
    pan-European market in investment services through the
    establishment of a single set of European regulatory rules.
    Among its impacts are changes in the way trades can be executed,
    the level of protection afforded to investors, the integration
    of commodity related financial instruments into financial
    regulation and pre and post trade transparency in equity
    markets. These changes affect Merrill Lynchs European
    regulated entities and the clients and counterparties with which
    they trade. Under MiFID Merrill Lynch, through its European
    regulated entities, undertook a global communication exercise to
    affected clients providing information on the impact of MiFID
    and completed infrastructure enhancements to ensure affected
    Merrill Lynch entities are MiFID compliant.

   Legal
    Proceedings
    



 

    ML & Co., certain of its subsidiaries, including
    MLPF&S, and other persons have been named as parties in
    various legal actions and arbitration proceedings arising in
    connection with the operation of ML & Co.s
    businesses. In most cases, plaintiffs seek unspecified damages
    and other relief. These actions include the following:

 

IPO Underwriting
    Fee Litigation


In re Public Offering Fee Antitrust Litigation and In re
    Issuer Plaintiff Initial Public Offering Fee Antitrust
    Litigation: Beginning in 1998, Merrill Lynch was named
    as one of approximately two dozen defendants in purported class
    actions filed in the United States District Court for the
    Southern District of New York alleging that underwriters
    conspired to fix the fee paid to purchase certain
    initial public offering securities at 7% in violation of
    antitrust laws. These complaints have been filed by both
    investors and issuers in initial public offerings. On
    February 24, 2004, the court held that the purchaser
    plaintiffs claims for damages were barred, but declined to
    dismiss the claim for injunctive relief. On April 18, 2006,
    the court held that the issuer claim could not proceed as a
    class action. On September 11, 2007, the Second Circuit
    Court of Appeals vacated the April 18 decision and remanded the
    case for further proceedings on the issue of class
    certification. Following the remand, plaintiffs have moved for
    class certification of the issuer class, and the defendants have
    opposed class certification. The court has not issued a decision
    on the class certification issue.

 

IPO Allocation
    Litigation


In re Initial Public Offering Securities
    Litigation: Beginning in 2001, Merrill Lynch was named
    as one of the defendants in approximately 110 securities class
    action complaints alleging that dozens of underwriter defendants
    artificially inflated and maintained the stock prices of
    securities by creating an artificially high post-IPO demand for
    shares. On October 13, 2004, the district court, having
    previously denied defendants motions to dismiss, issued an
    order allowing certain of these cases to proceed against the
    underwriter defendants as class actions. On December 5,
    2006, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this order,
    holding that the district court erred in certifying these cases
    as class actions. On September 27, 2007, plaintiffs again
    moved for class certification. On December 21, 2007,
    defendants filed their opposition to plaintiffs motion.
    The court has not issued a decision on the class certification
    issue.

 

Enron
    Litigation


Newby v. Enron Corp. et al.: On April 8, 2002,
    Merrill Lynch was added as a defendant in a consolidated class
    action filed in the United States District Court for the
    Southern District of Texas on behalf of the purchasers of
    Enrons publicly traded equity and debt securities during
    the period October 19, 1998 through November 27, 2001.
    The complaint alleges, among other things, that Merrill Lynch
    engaged in improper transactions in the fourth quarter of 1999
    that helped Enron misrepresent its earnings and revenues in the
    fourth quarter of 1999. The district court denied Merrill
    Lynchs motions to dismiss, and certified a class action by
    Enron shareholders and bondholders against Merrill Lynch and
    other defendants. On March 19, 2007, the Fifth Circuit
    Court of Appeals reversed the district courts decision
    certifying the case as a class action. On January 22, 2008,
    the Supreme Court denied plaintiffs petition to review the
    Fifth Circuits decision. Merrill Lynch intends to move for
    summary judgment dismissing the action. Plaintiffs have stated
    they will oppose that motion.

 

Other Enron
    Litigation


    Over a dozen other actions have been brought against Merrill
    Lynch and other investment firms in connection with their
    Enron-related activities. There has been no adjudication of the
    merits of these claims.

 

Mortgage-Related
    Litigation


Merrill Lynch & Co. Shareholder
    Litigation: Beginning on October 30, 2007,
    purported class actions were filed in the United States District
    Court for the Southern District of New York against Merrill
    Lynch and certain present or former officers and directors on
    behalf of persons who acquired Merrill Lynch securities
    beginning as early as November 3, 2006 and ending as late
    as November 7, 2007. Among other things, the complaints
    allege violations of the federal securities laws based on
    alleged false and misleading statements related to Merrill
    Lynchs exposure to collateralized debt obligations and the
    sub-prime lending markets. One such action is brought on behalf
    of persons who exchanged the securities of First Republic Bank
    for the securities of Merrill Lynch in a merger that occurred on
    September 21, 2007. Merrill Lynch intends to vigorously
    defend itself in these actions.

 

Shareholder Derivative Actions: Beginning on
    November 1, 2007, purported shareholder derivative actions
    were brought in federal and state courts against certain present
    or former officers and directors of Merrill Lynch in which the
    Company is named as a nominal defendant. The actions allege,
    among other things, breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste,
    and abuse of control related to Merrill Lynchs exposure to
    collateralized debt obligations and the sub-prime lending
    markets. They also challenge the payment of alleged severance to
    Merrill Lynchs former chief executive officer and certain
    of the actions assert claims for contribution or indemnification
    on the Companys behalf. In addition, the Company has
    received letters from law firms, on behalf of purported
    shareholders, demanding that the Board bring claims on behalf of
    Merrill Lynch against certain present and former directors and
    officers of Merrill Lynch based on allegations substantially
    similar to those that are alleged in the shareholder derivative
    actions described above. The Board, with the assistance of
    counsel, will review the claims made in the demand letters and
    determine whether the maintenance of the proposed derivative
    suits is in the best interests of the Company.

ERISA Litigation: Beginning on November 13,
    2007, purported class actions were filed in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of New York against
    Merrill Lynch and certain of its present or former officers and
    directors on behalf of the Merrill Lynch 401(k) Savings and
    Investment Plan, Retirement Accumulation Plan, Employee Stock
    Ownership Plan and a class of similarly situated plan
    participants. The actions are pending in the United States
    District Court for the Southern District of New York. These
    actions challenge the Companys disclosures about its
    performance, business prospects and the attractiveness of the
    Companys stock between a variety of purported class
    periods, beginning as early as January 1, 2004 and ending
    as late as December 6, 2007. Merrill Lynch intends to
    vigorously defend itself in these actions.

 

City of Cleveland v. Deutsche Bank Trust Company, et
    al.: On January 10, 2008, the City of Cleveland
    filed a lawsuit against twenty-one financial services firms,
    including Merrill Lynch, alleging that the securitization of
    sub-prime mortgages created a public nuisance and
    that defendants are, therefore, liable for the cost incurred by
    the City of Cleveland related to foreclosures. The case was
    initially filed in the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court and
    was removed to the United States District Court for the Northern
    District of Ohio on January 17, 2008. Plaintiff has filed a
    motion seeking an order remanding the case. Merrill Lynch
    intends to vigorously defend itself in this action.

 

Regulatory Investigations: Merrill Lynch is
    cooperating with the SEC and other regulators investigating
    sub-prime-related activities.

 

Allegheny Energy
    Litigation


Merrill Lynch v. Allegheny Energy, Inc.: On
    September 24, 2002, Merrill Lynch filed an action in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York against Allegheny Energy, Inc. The complaint alleged that
    Allegheny owed Merrill Lynch the final $115 million payment
    due in connection with Alleghenys purchase of Merrill
    Lynchs energy trading business and assets in 2001. The
    following day, Allegheny filed an action against Merrill Lynch
    in the Supreme Court of the State of New York claiming
    misrepresentations in connection with Merrill Lynchs sale
    of the energy trading business to Allegheny. On July 18,
    2005, following a bench trial, the court issued a decision
    holding that Allegheny was required to pay Merrill Lynch
    $115 million plus interest. On August 31, 2007, the
    Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district
    courts decision and remanded the case for further
    proceedings in the district court. In January 2008, Allegheny
    and Merrill Lynch settled the matter. Under the terms of the
    settlement, Allegheny will pay Merrill Lynch $50 million
    and Merrill Lynch will relinquish its interest in Allegheny
    Energy Supply LLC.

 

Short Sales
    Litigation


Electronic Trading Group, LLC v. Banc of America Securities
    LLC, et al.: On April 12, 2006, a purported class
    action was filed against eleven financial services firms,
    including Merrill Lynch, in the United States District Court for
    the Southern District of New York. The case alleged that the
    defendants violated federal antitrust laws by charging unearned
    fees on short sales by their clients even when they failed to
    borrow
    and/or
    deliver stock in support of those short sales. On
    December 20, 2007, the court granted defendants
    motion to dismiss. Plaintiffs have filed an appeal.

 

Avenius v. Banc of America Securities LLC, et
    al.: On June 22, 2006, 37 purchasers of securities
    of NovaStar Financial filed an action against eleven financial
    services firms, including Merrill Lynch, in the California
    Superior Court in San Francisco. The case alleges that the
    defendants improperly depressed the price of NovaStar Financial
    shares by facilitating short sales that did not comply with
    regulatory requirements. Merrill Lynch is vigorously defending
    itself against these charges. On July 17, 2007, the
    Superior Court of the State of California, County of
    San Francisco, rejected defendants argument that
    state law claims of facilitating improper short sales were
    preempted by the federal securities laws. The court did not rule
    on the substance of the underlying claims. The defendants,
    including Merrill Lynch, are vigorously defending themselves
    against the claims.

 

Overstock.com, Inc. v. Morgan Stanley & Co.,
    et al.: On February 2, 2007, Overstock.com brought
    an action in the Superior Court of the State of California,
    County of San Francisco, against approximately a dozen
    investment banks, including Merrill Lynch, alleging that they
    violated state law by improperly facilitating short sales of
    Overstock.com, which artificially depressed the price of its
    shares. Merrill Lynch is vigorously defending itself against
    these charges. On July 17, 2007, the Superior Court of the
    State of California, County of San Francisco, rejected
    defendants argument that state law claims of facilitating
    improper short sales were preempted by the federal securities
    laws. The court did not rule on the substance of the underlying
    claims. The defendants, including Merrill Lynch, are vigorously
    defending themselves against the claims.

 

Bank Sweep
    Programs Litigation


DeBlasio v. Merrill Lynch, et al.: On
    January 12, 2007, a purported class action was brought
    against Merrill Lynch and three other securities firms in the
    United States District Court for the Southern District of New
    York alleging that their bank sweep programs violated state law
    because their terms were not adequately disclosed to customers.
    On May 1, 2007, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint,
    which added additional defendants. On November 12, 2007,

Private Equity
    Litigation


Davidson, et al., v. Bain Capital Partners, LLC, et
    al.: On December 28, 2007, a purported class
    action was brought against sixteen defendants, including Merrill
    Lynch, in the United States District Court for the District of
    Massachusetts. The complaint alleges that defendants conspired
    to limit competition in bidding for private-equity sponsored
    acquisitions of public companies in violation of the antitrust
    laws. Merrill Lynch intends to vigorously defend itself in this
    action.

 

Employment
    Litigation


McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch: On November 18,
    2005, a purported class action was filed in the United States
    District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking to
    certify a class of current and former African American Merrill
    Lynch employees, as well as African Americans who applied for
    employment. Plaintiff alleges that the firm has engaged in a
    pattern and practice of discrimination against African Americans
    in violation of federal Civil Rights statutes. Merrill Lynch is
    vigorously contesting these claims.

 

Other


    Merrill Lynch has been named as a defendant in various other
    legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other
    litigation arising in connection with its activities as a global
    diversified financial services institution. Some of the legal
    actions include claims for substantial compensatory
    and/or
    punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages.
    In some cases, the issuers that would otherwise be the primary
    defendants in such cases are bankrupt or otherwise in financial
    distress. Merrill Lynch is also involved in investigations
    and/or
    proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies.

 

    Merrill Lynch believes it has strong defenses to, and where
    appropriate, will vigorously contest, many of these matters.
    Given the number of these matters, some are likely to result in
    adverse judgments, penalties, injunctions, fines, or other
    relief. Merrill Lynch may explore potential settlements before a
    case is taken through trial because of the uncertainty, risks,
    and costs inherent in the litigation process. In accordance with
    SFAS No. 5, Merrill Lynch will accrue a liability when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In many lawsuits,
    arbitrations, and investigations, including the class action
    lawsuits disclosed in ML & Co.s public filings,
    it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been
    incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that
    liability until the matter is close to resolution, in which case
    no accrual is made until that time. In view of the inherent
    difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters,
    particularly in cases in which claimants seek substantial or
    indeterminate damages, Merrill Lynch cannot predict what the
    eventual loss or range of loss related to such matters will be.
    Subject to the foregoing, Merrill Lynch continues to assess
    these matters and believes, based on information available to
    it, that the resolution of these matters will not have a
    material adverse effect on the financial condition of Merrill
    Lynch as set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements, but
    may be material to Merrill Lynchs operating results or
    cash flows for any particular period and may impact
    ML & Co.s credit ratings.

    Securities




    On January 15, 2008, we reached separate agreements with

    Convertible Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 1, par

    less than 5% of our outstanding common stock. Certain terms of
